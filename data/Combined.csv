After a remote diamond mine collapses in the far northern regions of Canada, an ice driver leads an impossible rescue mission over a frozen ocean to save the lives of trapped miners despite thawing waters and a threat they never see coming. After the sudden collapse of tunnel six in the Katka Mine of Canada's Manitoba, killing eight miners and leaving twenty-six more unaccounted for, it falls to the seasoned big-rig driver, Mike McCann, to deliver a vital, 30-ton, 18-foot gas well-head and 300 feet of pipe up there in under 30 hours. Composed of Mike's aphasia-stricken brother, Gurty, the veteran truck driver, Jim Goldenrod, and Jim's brilliant ex-employee, Tantoo, the hand-picked team has to brave the elements and travel across the thin ice road of a frozen lake in April that can shatter to pieces at any moment. However, neither the ice cracking under their wheels nor the arctic blizzards can compare with the challenges that await the drivers ahead. Can the truckers make it to the mine in time? When a diamond mine collapses in Canada due to a methane explosion, a team of miners are trapped inside and the rescue team cannot use explosives since there is methane inside. The company tries to contract truck drives to bring the necessary rescue equipment in less than thirty hours since this is the maximum time that the miners can survive. They hire the experienced Mike McCann and his mechanic brother Gurty McCann; the Indian Tantoo; and the chief of the drivers Jim Goldenrod to drive three trucks and have redundancy in case of any accident. They also promise a two-hundred-dollar payment to be shared among the survivors and send the actuary Tom Varnay with them in Tantoo's truck. When Jim's engine blows-up and the truck sinks in the ice road with him, Varnay convinces the brothers that Tantoo has sabotaged the engine and they tie her up in her cabin. But soon Mike and Gurty learn that Tantoo is innocent and Varnay has a hidden agenda and they have to fight to survive along their journey through the ice road. An explosion at a mine in Manitoba traps 26 miners. Mike McCann and his brother Gurty, an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD and aphasia, work for a trucking company in North Dakota until Mike punches another trucker for referring to Gurty as a ""retard"", and they are both fired. Mike hears about ice road truckers needed in Winnipeg, and they apply. Jim Goldenrod, another trucker, agrees to lead a rescue mission to deliver wellheads to the mine. He hires McCann and Gurty, along with a young woman, Tantoo. Also joining is actuary Varnay, responsible for insurance risk assessment for Katka, the company which owns the mine. $200,000 is split between the four truckers, which will be redistributed among the survivors if anyone dies. Meanwhile, the miners are communicating with Katka executives, and Katka General Manager Sickle transmits a message that they plan to free the men by blasting a tunnel.The team leaves for the mine with three wellheads.",action,"[[[ 95 124 142]

Going on a bender together to drown their sorrows each for a different reason, they awaken the morning after in bed together in a Las Vegas hotel room to discover that they got married.

What she doesn't expect is that Nate tells his family of their marriage in they being more accepting of her working in the business in she being family herself.

However, Nate's grandmother, Faye Bynam, the company's matriarch, quietly sees in Riley just what the company needs. And third, the man Riley made a connection with when she first arrived into town is Nate's brother, Rhys Bynam, who has always had an issue with Buck but who has returned to town to help get the company back on its feet.

After settling in, Jessica instructs John to purchase veal cutlets for dinner despite John preferring hamburgers. At the store in town, Anna takes an interest in yearold local Isaac, who flirts oddly with Anna.

Inspired by the actual files of Father Gabriele Amorth, Chief Exorcist of the Vatican, The Pope's Exorcist follows Amorth as he investigates a young boy's terrifying possession and ends up uncovering a centuries-old conspiracy the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden. Rome, 1987. Having performed hundreds of successful exorcisms throughout his decades-long career, Father Gabriele Amorth, the Vatican's chief exorcist, travels to Spain to shed light on the peculiar case of troubled Henry, a boy reportedly possessed by a powerful unholy spirit. But as the child's condition deteriorates, the grizzled priest joins forces with local cleric Father Tomas Esquibel to cast out the demonic legions from possessed Henry. However, the exorcism is just the tip of the iceberg. Can guilt, sin, and a well-hidden, centuries-old conspiracy threaten the soul of the Pope's exorcist? Father Gabriele Amorth, the Pope's personal exorcist, and an earthy, humorous, practical man at times, arrives at a small village in Italy where a man is allegedly possessed by a spirit. Along with the local priest he enters the room where the man was tied up. While exorcising the man, he refers to the spirit as Satan and sends it into a pig which was brought in for the exorcism. As soon as the spirit enters the pig, Amorth shoots it with a shotgun.This incident gets him in trouble with a Church tribunal, since he acted without permission from superiors. One tribunal member is a friendly African bishop, Lumumba, but one is a vicious American cardinal, Sullivan, skeptical of exorcism and even demonic possession. Amorth replies that evil does exist, and that he did not perform an exorcism, but rather, some psychological theater to help the mentally-disturbed man. Disgusted, Amorth walks out of the tribunal.After this, the Pope assigns him to visit a possessed little boy named Henry in Spain. Henry, his mother Julia, and his rebellious teenage sister Amy travel to Spain from America to take possession of a mysterious old abbey which was Henry's father's sole bequest to his family after he died in a car accident, with Henry also present. The traumatized Henry has not spoken since the accident. Workmen, who were restoring the abbey so the family could sell it, leave after a sinister fire. Henry starts behaving bizarrely; brain tests show nothing abnormal.",horror,"[[[22  2  0]

""Licorice Pizza"" is the story of Alana Kane and Gary Valentine growing up, running around, and falling in love in the San Fernando Valley in 1973. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the film tracks the treacherous navigation of first love.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—United Artist Releasing', ""San Fernando Valley, 1973. Disarmed by his fearless confidence and surprising maturity, bored 25-year-old photographer's assistant Alana Kane reluctantly accepts to go out for a drink with sunny 15-year-old child actor Gary Valentine, her unexpected admirer. As one thing leads to another, the platonic soulmates embark on ambitious business ventures, trying to find their feet and purpose in a crazy world. But can Gary and Alana remain friends against the backdrop of life's ups and downs? California, early-1970s. Gary Valentine, a 15-year-old boy, is attracted to Alana Kane, the 20-something-year-old who appeared at his school to assist with taking school photos. He asks her out and after many such requests she reluctantly agrees. San Fernando Valley, 1973 - Several boys are getting ready to have their pictures taken, while a couple of others set off a cherry bomb in the bathroom. One of the boys, Gary Valentine (Cooper Hoffman), sees the photographer's assistant, Alana Kane (Alana Haim), and becomes smitten with her. He tries to talk to her, though she seems disinterested due to the fact that she is 25 and he is 15. Gary tells Alana that he is an actor, and he eventually succeeds in getting her to agree to hang out with him, but not as a date.Gary and Alana meet at a restaurant that he frequents since he appears to know the manager. The two discuss their jobs, and Gary mentions that he also works with his mother at a public relations company. Gary assures Alana that they are not going to forget each other. They walk home, and we see Alana lives with her parents and two sisters (all played by Haim's real family), while Gary lives with his brother Greg (Milo Herschlag).Gary works with his mom, Momma Anita (Mary Elizabeth Ellis), and they meet with a restaurant owner, Jerry Frick (John Michael Higgins), and his wife Mioko (Yumi Mizui), over a new Japanese restaurant they are trying to open. Jerry speaks with a accent racist accent to his wife. Later on, Anita tells Gary that she can't accompany him for a trip to New York where he will be featured on auditions and a variety show.Alana accompanies Gary to New York, where he rejoins his movie partners from the film ""Under One Roof"", where he starred as one of many siblings along with renowned actress Lucille Dolittle (Christine Ebersole). During the show, Gary hits Lucille over the head with a pillow, and when being interviewed, he makes a joke about ""doing three beavers"". Lucille later angrily chastises him and hits him. Afterward, Gary meets with an agent, Gale (Maya Rudolph), and does a commercial for a vest. While this happens, Alana befriends another actor named Lance (Skyler Gisondo).Upon returning to California, Alana begins a relationship with Lance. However, when she brings him over for dinner with her family, he declines to say a prayer because, despite being raised in the Jewish faith, he identifies as an atheist. Alana breaks things off with him shortly afterward.Gary soon gets into the waterbed business and gets his friends Kirk (Will Arangola) and Mark (Griff Giacchino), along with Alana, now that they are becoming friends, although Gary is still in love with her. They go to an expo called Soggy Bottom, where there are other booths like one for ""The Munsters"", with Fred Gwynne (John C. Reilly) in attendance. As Gary tries to sell the water beds, cops come to aggressively arrest him on suspicion of murder. Alana runs all the way to the police station, where Gary is soon let go when their first suspect says he doesn't know Gary. He leaves the station and hugs Alana.Alana operates the phones at the waterbed business, with Gary telling her to sound ""sexier"", but he feels she overdoes it. He later accompanies her to meet an agent, Mary Grady (Harriet Sansom Harris). When she asks Alana if she would do nudity in films, she initially says yes, but Gary urges her to say no. The two argue on the way home because Gary isn't comfortable with audiences seeing Alana nude when he can't. She later relents and shows him her breasts but slaps him when he asks to touch them.Alana joins Gary at an event to sell waterbeds, where Gary meets a girl from school named Sue Pomerantz (Isabelle Kusman). The two chat and go off to hook up, which Alana sees and appears jealous for it. She randomly kisses another guy out of spite and then walks home in nothing but her underwear (as she was modeling that way).Later on, Alana goes to an audition for a part alongside actor Jack Holden (Sean Penn). He takes a liking to her and compares her to Grace Kelly. Jack takes Alana to a bar, ""The Tail o' the Cock"", where Gary and his friends also make an appearance. Jack runs into his old friend, director Rex Blau (Tom Waits), and they convince everyone in attendance to watch Jack recreate a motorcycle stunt from his film ""The Bridges of Toko-San"", which he did with Kelly. Alana sits on the back of the motorcycle, but as soon as Jack takes off, Alana falls backwards. Gary runs all the way to Alana to make sure she is okay while everyone else cheers for Jack. He walks back with her to the waterbed store where she falls asleep. Gary contemplates groping her but decides against it.News reports come out that there is an oil embargo that is creating a gas crisis, which Alana says is in part thanks to the waterbeds, since they are made from vinyl, and vinyl is made from oil. The two, plus Greg, Kirk, and Mark, later deliver a waterbed to the home of producer Jon Peters (Bradley Cooper), who is something of a lunatic. He grills Gary for the pronunciation of his girlfriend's name (being Barbra Streisand), and explicitly threatens to kill Gary's whole family if he messes anything up during the setup. Gary and Alana set up the water bed, but accidentally pull the hose out and get the carpet wet. They get the other three boys out of there quickly.On their way out, they run into Jon coming up a hill, where he forces them to take him to the gas station to fill up since his car broke down. They leave him there when they see Jon threatening to light a man on fire by spraying him with the gas nozzle while holding a lighter. They drive back towards Jon's car, where Gary starts to smash the windshield. Unfortunately, their truck runs out of gas, and they have to roll the truck carefully down the hills backwards until it eventually stops in the middle of the street somewhere. Gary and the boys go off to get gas, while Alana sits on the street. Jon walks nearby and throws a garbage bin through a store window, but she manages to avoid being seen by him before he tries to hit on two tennis players.With the waterbed business failing from the gas crisis, Gary and Alana look to move onto other work. Gary invests in a pinball arcade while Alana decides to do volunteer work for mayoral candidate Councilman Joel Wachs (Benny Safdie). Gary and Alana have an argument, leading to them parting ways.While Alana is taking calls at the campaign office, she notices a creepy guy (Jon Beavers) scoping the office out. She confronts him but he gives her vague responses as to why he is there. Alana is later invited to drinks with Wachs, where the creepy guy is sitting nearby again. She meets Wachs' partner Matthew (Joseph Cross), and Alana learns that Wachs is gay and that the creep is most likely a spy trying to dig up dirt on Wachs and his campaign. Wachs asks Alana to go home with Matthew and pretend that she is his girlfriend. When they get home, Matthew breaks down in tears, asking Alana if she has a boyfriend. She says ""yes and no"", but they both cry over the fact that the guys in their life are jerks.Gary is at the opening of his pinball arcade, dealing with obnoxious kids and adults. He runs into Alana's friend and asks where she is. He runs to the campaign office to look for her but she is not there. Similarly, Alana goes to the restaurant where she first went out with Gary, but he isn't there. They eventually keep going until they literally run into each other in front of the movie theater. Gary brings Alana back to the arcade and introduces her as ""Mrs. Alana Valentine"". She calls him an idiot, but he then kisses her.The two run off again together, with Alana telling Gary that she loves him.",comedy,"[[[255 255 255]

Soon Wes realizes he is involved in a situation more terrible than he could imagine. Sometimes, all it takes is a second to change your life or mess things up. And following a messy break-up, Wes--a heartbroken, down-on-his-luck loser--is now in a bad place. So, wracked with grief and self-loathing, despondent Wes pulls over at a rural rest stop, polishes off a bottle of cheap whiskey, and wakes up hungover the next morning. But as the defeated man enters the bathroom to worship the porcelain god, a moment of confusion locks Wes inside the squalid public toilet. And then, as if suffering from a long streak of bad luck weren't enough, a genial, deep-voiced stranger from the elaborately decorated adjacent stall strikes up a conversation, genuinely concerned about Wes. However, as Wes indulges his neighbour's curiosity, a sinister undercurrent of pent-up stress ratchets up the tension. But Wes only wants his girl back.

26,tt7144666,"After being abducted by a child killer and locked in a soundproof basement, a 13-year-old boy starts receiving calls on a disconnected phone from the killer's previous victims. Finney Blake is a shy but clever 13-year-old boy who is abducted by a sadistic killer and trapped in a soundproof basement where screaming is of no use. When a disconnected phone on the wall begins to ring, Finney discovers that he can hear the voices of the killer's previous victims. And they are dead-set on making sure that what happened to them doesn't happen to Finney. North Denver, 1978. As the dreadful infamy of the stealthy child abductor known as The Grabber spreads across the city, terrorising its residents, tight-knit siblings Finney and Gwen live in fear of two things: the masked serial killer and their abusive father. When the monstrous Grabber kidnaps yet another defenceless boy, two local detectives embark on a time-sensitive mission to shed light on the knotty child disappearance cases, trying to piece insubstantial evidence together. However, the disconnected black rotary telephone on the wall of the deranged kidnapper's well-soundproofed basement keeps ringing. But who's on the other end of the line? Kids are disappearing in a quiet suburb of Denver. The latest victim, Finney Blake, finds himself imprisoned in a basement. His masked kidnapper hasn't harmed him but how long will that last? There's a black phone on the wall of his cell which is supposed to be inoperable but Finney keeps getting calls from previous victims. They give him clues on how to escape his kidnapper. In addition his sister is having dreams of Finney's situation, providing clues to his location. In 1978, a serial child abductor nicknamed ""The Grabber"" prowls the streets of a Denver suburb. Siblings Finney and Gwen Blake live in the area with their abusive, alcoholic father. At school, Finney is frequently bullied and harassed. He has a friendship with a classmate, Robin, who fends off the bullies. A boy from another school that Finney knew, Bruce, is abducted by the Grabber. Gwen, who has psychic dreams much like her late mother, dreams of Bruce's kidnapping and sees that he was taken by a man in a black van with black balloons. Detectives Wright and Miller interview Gwen but struggle to believe her claims. The Grabber abducts Robin, as well as Finney days later. Finney awakens in a soundproofed basement. On the wall is a disconnected black rotary phone that the Grabber says does not work. Later, Finney hears the phone ring and answers it. Bruce's ghost, unable to remember his own name or who he was when he was alive, tells Finney about a floor tile he can remove to dig a tunnel to escape.The police search for Finney is unsuccessful. The Grabber brings Finney\'s food and leaves the door to the basement unlocked.",horror,"[[[255 255 255]

31,tt9686790,"The film opens on an island resort in the Philippines. Families and friends are gathered for the wedding of Darcy Rivera (Jennifer Lopez) and Tom Fowler (Josh Duhamel). Darcy shows up to a dinner where she meets with her mother, Renata (Sonia Braga), who thinks the big wedding is too flashy. Meanwhile, Tom is setting up a surprise for Darcy on a motorboat but gets startled by the security guard, causing him to fall into the water.

Tom's mother, Carol (Jennifer Coolidge), arrives with her second husband, Larry (Steve Coulter). At the same time, Darcy's father, Robert (Cheech Marin), shows up with his new younger girlfriend, Harriet (D'Arcy Carden), which annoys Renata since she still hates Robert after their divorce. While Darcy and Tom try to spend time together, Tom gets pulled away by his best friend/best man Ricky (Desmin Borges), leaving Darcy to be with her younger sister Jamie (Callie Hernandez). Complicating matters is the arrival of Darcy's charming ex-boyfriend Sean (Lenny Kravitz), who was invited by Robert. He calls Darcy ""Dee Dee,"" and his presence puts Tom on edge, with everyone seeing he is clearly jealous. Tom delivers a speech that is upstaged by Sean's more personal speech toward Darcy. This is followed by Tom's sister Jeannie (Melissa Hunter) delivering a speech discussing her recent marital problems.

Darcy and Tom try to wind down and get intimate with one another, but it is interrupted by Carol coming in to offer words that she thinks are encouraging, but they really aren't. The couple ends up sleeping separately.

The next morning is wedding day. As preparations are being made, a group of pirates makes their way toward the island after seeing the couple's wedding website. Darcy is helped by Renata, Jamie, and Carol into her dress, but she feels that something isn't right. She texts Tom to meet privately, and Darcy says she feels that having everyone come to the Philippines for their wedding was too much, as she never wanted a big wedding. They argue until they decide that they ought to call off the wedding, just as the pirates storm the resort and take the staff and guests hostage. Tom witnesses this and runs to warn Darcy. The pirates force everyone into a pool and demand a $45 million ransom from Robert, as they know how wealthy he is.

Tom gets Darcy out of her room and tells her what's happening. They see an armed pirate attempting to break in and try to come up with a plan to trap him. While they attempt to subdue him with their own ideas (Tom wants to trap him in a net while Darcy thinks spraying his eyes with hairspray would do the trick), they both get taken down and are tied up together. The pirates then head with the couple to bring them to their leader, but Darcy asks for a cigarette and uses it to light the pirates' heads on fire, causing them to jump out and leaving the couple to try and take control of the driver less cart. They manage to jump out, but Darcy's dress gets caught and is mostly ripped off as the cart falls over a cliff. They are then attacked by one of the pirates, but Darcy manages to pull a grenade from his hand, and Tom kicks him and makes him fall against a rock, killing him. This leaves him mortified at killing a man.

Darcy and Tom try to find a way to untie themselves, but Tom informs Darcy to be careful with the grenade she is holding because it doesn't have a pin in it, and her dropping it could set it off. They try to find an area with good cell reception so they can call for help, but they get chased by more pirates, and Darcy drops the phone. They find a zip line tower where they descend, and Darcy drops the grenade on two pirates, which alerts the others to their location when it blows up. When the couple lands, they are scared to see their loved ones being held hostage and try to find a way to get help.

The couple goes into the kitchen to find a way to cut their bindings. A female pirate enters just as they cut themselves free with a deli slicer (but Tom gets a nasty cut on his hand that makes Darcy faint). Tom fights the pirate until he knocks her out by smashing her through a glass window. When Darcy comes to her senses, she shortens her dress and wears boots so she can spring into action and help Tom save their loved ones.

Darcy and Tom find the main office of the resort but find that they have no internet. The owners, Margy (Selena Tan) and Ace (Alberto Isaac), hide the couple in their bunker. While tending to Tom's wound, Margy lets it slip that the resort was hit by pirates the previous summer, which Tom had known about. Darcy yells at Tom over this and his habit of self-sabotaging and his insecurities, which is what led him to make the big wedding. Tom hits back that Darcy is putting on a big front of being confident when she is also scared. Tom then takes responsibility for the hostages since he brought them all there. When another pirate starts getting close, Ace and Margy send the couple down a tunnel, but Tom gets out and turns himself in to be captured, leaving Darcy hidden.

Tom is brought to the other hostages. He tells the lead pirate a phrase in Balinese (which means ""fuck your grandpa""), and he then holds Sean at knife-point. Tom deduced that Sean is the bad guy who hired the pirates because Sean had said the phrase earlier, and Tom figured the pirates are Balinese. He even produces a wedding invitation that one of the pirates had, and Tom states that Sean had hoped to get the ransom from Robert since he did not give him investment money. Sean drops the act and breaks free, joining the pirates and holding a gun at Tom.

Darcy begins to feel bad while staying with Ace and Margy over her argument with Tom, so she is encouraged to save everyone herself. Sean takes the lead pirate with him to go find Darcy, using Harriet as collateral and taking her with him in his helicopter. Darcy arrives with a gun and tries to reconcile with Tom before taking on the pirates. The pirates end up taking Darcy with the other hostages, with one of the pirates personally wanting to kill Darcy because she burned his face. The others then learn that Harriet was in on the scheme the whole time, as Larry had been recording everything and got footage of her and Sean making out. While in the helicopter, Harriet kills the lead pirate by hitting a pressure point to paralyze him and then throws him out of the helicopter.

Darcy and Tom devise a plan by doing an impromptu wedding ceremony in the pool, which the pirates allow. Carol leads everyone to sing the song ""I'll Be"" before the couple seizes an opportunity to fight back (with Carol getting her hands on a rifle too). They use another grenade to kill the pirates, setting off some fireworks that alert Sean and Harriet. Ace and Margy help the guests get to safety while Darcy and Tom try to stop the villains.

The couple makes it to the docks, where they subdue a young pirate and try to take the motorboat that Tom was going to surprise Darcy with. They are found by Sean, who attempts to get Darcy on his side, but she refuses to join him. She and Tom hop in the boat while Sean hangs on to go after them. Harriet attempts to shoot at them from the helicopter. As Darcy speeds the boat up, Tom and Sean get caught in a para-sail that flies upwards. Tom uses a chunk of fake hair to zip line down, and Darcy uses a cake knife that Carol gave her to cut the para-sail loose, causing Sean to get shredded by the helicopter's blades, and Harriet goes down into the ocean when the helicopter crashes.

Darcy and Tom make it back to the island, where they fully reconcile and agree to go on with their wedding. Authorities show up to arrest the surviving pirates, and Darcy and Tom finally get married. Jamie and Ricky (who were hooking up) then accidentally set off the last firework.",romance,"[[[ 18  75  94]

32,tt9054192,"A pair of housewives create a  million coupon scam.A team of FBI agents burst into the home of Connie Kaminski Kristen Bell to arrest her. Her voiceover narration says that she is getting ahead of herself in the story, so she goes back to the beginning.Almost a year earlier, Connie is shown being jobless and saving money with coupons. She is married to IRS agent Rick Joel McHale, who is unpleasant and unsupportive toward Connie, only telling her to get a job instead of being home stocking up on products that she bought with coupons. They have also tried to conceive a child, but Connie suffered a miscarriage and they are paying off debts from fertility treatments. Connie is best friends with Joanna ""JoJo"" Johnson Kirby HowellBaptiste, who lives with her mother, Mama Josie Greta Oglesby. JoJo has been unable to secure proper employment since she had her identity stolen, so she makes YouTube videos to try and generate revenue. The local mailman, Earl Dayo Okeniyi, has an obvious crush on JoJo.After a particularly frustrating day, Connie writes a complaint letter to General Mills about the Wheaties she ate being stale, and soon, she receives a coupon for a free box of cereal. She then learns from JoJo that companies do this all the time, so she writes multiple complaint letters to receive multiple free coupons. The ladies then learn that the coupons come from a factory in Chihuahua, Mexico, and they hatch a plan to head down there and collect the coupons to redistribute to other moms and wives.In Carson City, Nevada, Ken Miller Paul Walter Hauser works as an agent to prevent losses for certain stores and companies. He chides a woman at a store for attempting to use a fake coupon for a discount, even though the cashier is willing to let it slide. Ken travels back to his home in Salt Lake City, where he is just lonely.Connie and JoJo make their travel to Mexico and encounter a couple, Alejandro Francisco Rodriguez and Rosa Ilia Paulino, who agree to help them out by taking the unused coupons. Once they get their hands on them, the ladies begin their own website and small business ""Savvy Super Saver"", which helps them sell a lot of coupons and generate profit. However, this also catches the attention of Ken, who learns about the coupons and the losses some companies are taking. Ken annoys his superiors until he makes it an official case that he can take on.The ladies' account is frozen due to suspicious activity, so Connie finds out they need to prove they are a legitimate business. With that, they must turn to the hacker that stole JoJo's identity, Tempe Tina Bebe Rexha. They get in touch with Tina and are taken to her secret location, where she instructs Connie and JoJo on how to keep their operation lowkey and how to keep their money secure, including by using JoJo's cosmetics brand Back  Black as a front for their coupon business.After six months, Connie and JoJo figure their money is safe to use, but because it's dirty money, they need to spend it and clean it. They start buying things like sports cars, boats, planes, and guns. Meanwhile, Ken is partnered with a rep from the post office named Simon Kilmurry Vince Vaughn. Tempe Tina then contacts Connie and JoJo for their overspending and tells them that their money was always clean, and now their purchases are just making them look more suspicious. Tina tells them to take money out from the bank in small increments and to get rid of all their big purchases.JoJo later takes Connie to the fertility clinic where she decides to give it another shot at getting pregnant. Instead of using Rick's sample, she uses an anonymous donor instead. They later sell off their guns to a militia.Ken and Simon bond on their mission, with Simon sympathizing with Ken for how much devotion he puts to the job. They go around interviewing people from grocery stores where the ladies have shopped, and almost all of them recognize Connie because they find her constant use of coupons to be irritating. They are even able to place her behind the super saver website because their slogan is the same phrase that Connie uses when she shops. When they interview a group of postal workers, they remember JoJo because Earl is always watching her videos. He ends up trying to warn her while Ken and Simon try and stake out by her house.After gathering more evidence on the women, Ken and Simon are able to get agents to go and arrest Connie and JoJo. The two are placed in jail, but while JoJo is let out on bail, Connie is only visited by Rick so he can admonish her for what she has done. Having had enough of his lack of support, she declares that she wants a divorce. The ladies are then put on trial, where JoJo is given ten days in prison plus a year of probation, while Connie is sentenced to eleven months, but possibly eight with good behavior. Ken thinks they were let off too easy, but the companies that the ladies ripped off just wanted the case swept under the rug to avoid bad publicity.JoJo begins a relationship with Earl and relocates to Montenegro where they can keep using the makeup business front and continue the coupon business there to avoid the law. Connie stocks up on goods in prison and has gotten pregnant. She continues to try and look on the upside as she makes it through her sentence. thanks to Jeremy  themoviespoiler",comedy,"[[[0 0 0]

Stymied by the cadets' code of silence, he enlists one of their own to help unravel the case  a young man the world would come to know as Edgar Allan Poe. At West Point Academy in , the calm of an October evening is shattered by the discovery of a young cadet's body swinging from a rope just off the parade grounds. An apparent suicide is not unheard of in a harsh regimen like West Point's, but the next morning, an even greater horror comes to light. Someone has stolen into the room where the body lay and removed the heart. In October , alcoholic retired detective Augustus Landor is asked by the military to investigate the hanging of Cadet Leroy Fry at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Landor is a widower who lives alone since his daughter Mattie ran off a few years previously.After Fry was hanged, his heart was removed from his body. In the morgue, examining the corpse, Landor finds a small fragment of a note clutched tightly in Fry's hand. Also, marks on Fry's neck and fingers suggest that he did not hang himself, but was murdered.Landor secretly enlists the help of Edgar Allan Poe, another cadet at the academy, who has expressed an interest in the case. Poe and Landor deduce from the writing on the note fragment that it was summoning Fry to a secret meeting. After a cow and a sheep are found in the area, butchered and with their hearts removed, it is deduced that the murder could be linked to black magic rituals.Another cadet, Ballinger, goes missing and is later found hanged, with both his heart and his genitals removed. A third cadet, Stoddard, who was a colleague of the two victims, then disappears, and it is presumed by Landor that this man had reason to believe he was next in line to be killed.Landor and Poe begin to suspect the family of Dr. Daniel Marquis, who was first brought into the investigation to perform the autopsy on Fry.

The night of prom, a giant lizard monster attacked the school and tried to kill Peter's bully. Gwen, leaping into action as SpiderWoman, fought him off, causing the building to collapse on top of the creature. The lizard reverted to Peter, who was mortally injured by the rubble. Gwen tried to save him, but it was too late. Peter revealed he knew she was SpiderWoman, and reassured her before dying in her arms. Captain Stacy found her over Peter's body and assumed the masked vigilante murdered him, ordering a citywide manhunt for SpiderWoman.",action,"[[[139  49 147]

Ousmane Diakit Omar Sy and Franois Monge Laurent Lafitte are two cops with very different styles, backgrounds and careers. Many years ago they worked together but life took them apart. The unlikely pair is reunited once again for a new investigation that takes them all the way up to the French Alps. What seemed to be a simple drug deal turns out to be a high scale criminal case wrapped in danger and unexpected comedy.Netflix', 'The film follows Ousmane Diakhit Omar Sy, a rebel chief of the Paris crime division, and his old friend, Franois Monge Laurent Lafitte, a narcissist and selfabsorbed deputy chief of the district judicial police, who cross paths again after the events of the original film, ""On the Other Side of the Tracks,"" that came out in . Together, they go on a twoman mission to solve a murder case in Valergnes.Chief Ousmane Diakhit is a rebel police officer who doesn't abide by the laws and can go to any lengths to finish the mission. His recklessness and overconfidence is depicted in the opening sequence of the film, where Ousmane and his partner, Djimo, walk into an underground boxing arena to arrest Europe's most wanted criminal, Jordan Diaz. Ousmane acts all heroic and tries to arrest bulky Jordan without waiting for the backup team, which in turn leads to a ruckus that is recorded on camera. After Jordan's arrest, Ousmane's superior calls him unmanageable and obsessive, yet doesn't take any action against him because of his recent social media popularity. Instead, the department wants to wash off their sins and make him the poster boy of the police department because of his skin color. However, Ousmane has no interest in promoting anyone's agenda and thus declines the offer without a second thought.In the other part of the story, Franois Monge, deputy chief of the th district Judicial Police, is sitting in front of his therapist for evaluation after his colleagues reported his severe superiority complex and called him a liability for the department.

56,tt18411490,"In 1999 in London, a teenage Zoya (Katrina Kaif) witnesses her father, ISI agent Rehan Nazar (Aamir Bashir), die in a bomb blast. Rehan had taught Zoya that a person who kills without a reason is a terrorist and not a soldier. Rehan was a supporter of democracy and was eliminated after Musharraf came to power after removing Nawaz Sharif from the post of PM of Pakistan. After his funeral, she is visited by Nazar's protege, Aatish Rehman (Emraan Hashmi), who convinces her to join the ISI. Zoya believes that India was responsible for the death of her father.

In the present, Avinash ""Tiger"" Singh Rathore (Salman Khan) is called for a mission by the new RAW chief Maithili Menon (Revathi) to rescue Tiger's former handler Gopi Arya (Ranvir Shorey), who was captured in Afghanistan after trying to extract information from the Taliban about a mission being planned in Pakistan. Following his rescue, Gopi reveals to Tiger that Zoya is involved in the planned mission and succumbs to his injuries. This effectively means that Zoya is a double agent, pretending to be associated with RAW, but secretly working for the ISI. Zoya is at their home in Austria with their son Junior. Tiger begins to spy on Zoya and is later assigned to safeguard a RAW agent named Jibran Sheikh (Neeraj Purohit) in St. Petersburg, Russia, who worked with Gopi and escaped to the country after being discovered in Pakistan. Jibran was the arms supplier to the outfit inside Pakistan, which was planning the massive mission. He has vital information about the players involved in the new outfit.

Pakistan PM Nasreen Irani is a peace advocate and advocates a 50% cut in Pakistan's defense budget, if India also reciprocates. Zoya tells Tiger that Nasreen has painted a target on herself by announcing the budget cuts as the future of Pakistan is decided by the Army.

Tiger witnesses Zoya's attempt to assassinate Sheikh; after saving him. Tiger is unable to shoot at Zoya and is captured by Aatish. Aatish reveals that he enforced Zoya to assassinate Sheikh by near-fatally drugging and kidnapping her and Tiger's son Junior (Sartaaj Kakkar). In a flashback twelve years prior, It is revealed that Aatish sought to derail a peace treaty between India and Pakistan in Vienna by assassinating the General Ribiero, Chief of the Army Staff (India) (Bimal Oberoi). Aatish is against any attempts between India and Pakistan to make any progress towards peace or normal relations. After refusing to cooperate with the plan (she says that she works for Pakistan and not Aatish), Zoya covertly informs Tiger. Aatish's pregnant wife, Shaheen Baig (Riddhi Dogra), attempts the assassination herself, but was shot and killed by Tiger. Aatish denied that his agents knew of the plan and was subsequently imprisoned and ousted from the ISI.

Back in the present, Aatish reveals that he has Junior in his custody and wants Tiger and Zoya to carry out his mission in exchange for Junior's life. Tiger and Zoya recruit their team of RAW agents Rakesh (Kumud Mishra), Karan (Anant Vidhaat Sharma) and Nikhil (Chandrachoor Rai), to steal a briefcase for Aatish, containing missile launch codes in Istanbul in exchange for Junior. Zoya brings the briefcase to Aatish while Tiger is pursued and arrested by the Turkish police, who was informed by Aatish.

Aatish then has Tiger and Zoya framed as traitors by their respective countries, leading to Tiger's detention at an army prison in Northern Pakistan. Aatish knows that now both ISI and RAW are enemies of Zoya and Tiger. Pakistan will believe that the duo has stolen the codes to deliver to India, while India will believe that Tiger and Zoya plan to launch the nukes at them. The Indian Government brands Tiger as a rogue agent and asks the PM of Pakistan to conduct his trial as their laws. Meanwhile ISI dispatches their agents after Zoya to recover their launch codes. Menon also asks Rakesh, Karan and Nikhil to recover the codes to avoid jail. Tiger is sentenced to death but manages to escape with the help of Pathaan (Shah Rukh Khan).

Tiger then travels to Islamabad where he meets his adopted son, Hassan (Vishal Jethwa), whom Tiger had rescued in a mission in Ikrit.

The RAW team and the ISI agents reach Zoya at the same time. Zoya convinces both teams that Aatish is behind stealing the launch codes. Tiger's team, Zoya and ISI agents Abrar (Gavie Chahal) and Javed (Danish Bhat) return to Islamabad, where they learn from Tiger that Aatish and Pakistani Army Chief of Army Staff General Imtiaz Haq (Shahid Latief) are planning to assassinate Prime Minister of Pakistan Nasreen Irani (Simran) in order for Aatish to replace her. Tiger, Zoya, and their team secretly enter the Pakistan's PMO and reveal the plan to Irani. Zoya says that Aatish had kidnapped their son to force them to steal the launch codes. Irani is convinced when Haq enters the PMO and starts attacking his way to Irani's office. Tiger and Zoya take Irani to an underground bunker and Tiger forces Haq to publicly reveal the plan.

However, Aatish secretly kills Haq (with a long-range rifle) with the help of Javed, who is revealed to be Shaheen's brother and frames Tiger for killing Haq. Aatish broadcasts live and declares that he has the launch codes, while Tiger has kept Irani captive and killed Haq. Aatish uses Javed, whose treachery is not revealed to Tiger and Zoya, to find their positions inside the PMO. Abrar and Karan are killed by Aatish and Javed, who locate Irani. But Zoya and Tiger manage to capture Aatish as they already knew that Javed was Shaheen's brother. But tables are turned when Javed captures Hassan. Hassan sacrifices himself, allowing Tiger and Zoya to regroup and form a strategy. Zoya takes Irani out of the bunker to safety, while Tiger engages Aatish inside the bunker.

Zoya avenges Abrar and Karan's deaths by killing Javed. Tiger and Aatish engage in a combat, resulting in Tiger killing Aatish. Irani broadcasts her speech from inside the PMO and exposes Aatish's plot to the public and Tiger, Zoya and their team are proven innocent. Tiger contacts Menon and assures her that he will always be there to serve his country.

In a mid-credits scene, Colonel Sunil Luthra (Ashutosh Rana) contacts Kabir Dhaliwal (Hrithik Roshan) and assigns him to assassinate an unidentified person.",action,"[[[255 255 255]

With the technological advances of the last  years, the game has upgraded, and it's just another day at the office when he's assigned to Rina Kimura, a crime boss' wife who's decided to turn state's evidence. As the two flee to Cape Town, South Africa, with a team of merciless assassins on their trail, Pollard discovers he's been set up. Doublecrossed and fueled by adrenaline, he needs to be at the top of his game, or he'll be the one who's erased. Mason Pollard played by Dominic Sherwood, is a deputy who saves the life of Sugar Jax, a witness who had blown his cover and was abducted by a few thugs who wanted to kill him for testifying against them. After saving Sugar's life, Mason shoots him with a fake bullet, thereby giving him another fake death in order to create a new cover for him so that he can easily leave the state. As soon as the film sets the premise, it quickly introduces the major conflict, which involves a woman named Rina Kimura, who is gathering evidence against a crime lord named Kosta.The FBI had planted Robyn Nhi Rina in the inner circle of Kosta Kimura to gather evidence against the criminal Syndicate for which he was working. The film quickly establishes that Kosta has married Rina, though he uses his wife to physically please his potential investors so that they will hand him the money without going too much into the details. Kosta has arranged a party to get some investors for a new project, and the FBI, hiding inside a van parked outside Kosta's villa, instructs Rina to use the distraction in their favor. The government authorities want some confidential information on Kosta; therefore, Rina walks into Kosta's office and opens his safe in order to transfer the files.",action,"[[[255 255 255]

Together they must embark on an adventure into the past to find their father, set things right, and save the world. As the three work together, both young and grown Adam come to terms with the loss of their father and have a chance to heal the wounds that have shaped them. Adding to the challenge of the mission, the two Adams discover that they really don't like each other much, and if they are to save the world, first they need to figure out how to get along. In a dystopian 2050, fighter pilot Adam Reed (Ryan Reynolds) steals his time jet and escapes through time on a rescue mission to 2018. However, he accidentally crash-lands in 2022 instead where Adam meets his 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell) who is struggling with the recent death of their father Louis (Mark Ruffalo) (Adam's father and a brilliant quantum physicist who wrote the algorithm necessary for controlled time travel) in a car accident.

Since Adam is injured, the jet wont clear him to fly or repair it because all his vitals are haywire). Adam sets the jet on self repair mode and tucks in for the night in the garage. The next day Ellie leaves for work. Adam tells Adam12 that he treats his mother badly and regrets it for the rest of his life. They go to a drug store to get supplies. Adam tries to get Adam12 to stand up to the bullies, but Adam12 gets beaten down again. Finally Adam takes on the bully and tells him to Adam12 alone.

He advises her to be more vulnerable and let Adam12 know that she is also hurting from the death of her husband. Adam reveals that he is looking for his wife, Laura (Zoe SaldaÃ±a), who was supposedly killed in a plane crash while on a time travel mission to 2018. They changed the jump logs and Adam never knew what she was chasing in 2018.Adam is being chased by Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener), the leader of the dystopian world and her lieutenant Christos (Alex Mallari Jr.) who attempt to apprehend Adam in 2022 and take him back to 2050.",action,"[[[6 5 3]

66,tt9013340,"A fool for love becomes an accidental celebrity only to lose it all. Fool's Paradise is a satirical comedy following a down-on-his-luck publicist (Ken Jeong), who gets his lucky break when he discovers a man recently released from a mental health facility (Day) looks just like a method actor who refuses to leave his trailer. With the help of a powerful producer (the late Ray Liotta), Ken helps the man become a huge star, even marrying his beautiful leading lady (Kate Beckinsale). Their adventures lead them to cross paths with drunken costars (Adrien Brody), irreverent unhoused action heroes (Common), unpredictable directors (Jason Sudeikis), a super-agent (Edie Falco), and power-mad moguls (John Malkovich). Fame and fortune are not all they are cracked up to be, and the two men must fight their way back to the things that matter the most. The story follows a mute man named John Doe, who has the mental capacity of a five-year-old. After being released from a mental hospital due to the state's inability to afford his treatment, John Doe ends up being homeless and takes directions from whoever he encounters. Meanwhile, a film producer, frustrated with actor Sir Tom Bingsley's refusal to leave his trailer during the shooting of a biopic about Billy the Kid, hires John Doe as a stand-in due to their uncanny resemblance. On the other hand, Lenny, a struggling publicist, aims to find talent by bribing his way onto studio lots. He mistakes John Doe's name for ""Latte Pronto"" due to a coffee-related demand from the producer. When Bingsley's method acting goes awry and he dies, John Doe, now referred to as Pronto, is forced to continue filming as the star. Despite his lack of acting skills and tendency to look directly into the camera, Pronto's co-stars, Christiana Dior and Chad Luxt, find inspiration in his supposed avant-garde performance and begin emulating his acting style. Lenny plans to catapult Pronto to stardom by securing him an agent and representation. Pronto befriends Luxt, who introduces him to the extravagant Hollywood lifestyle and takes him to wild parties. At the same time, Dior develops feelings for Pronto due to his genuine nature and convinces him to marry her, leading to increased media attention. The film ""Billy the Kid"" becomes a huge success, with critics applauding Pronto's unique breaking of the fourth wall by looking into the camera. However, conflicts arise during an after-party when Lenny asks Pronto to commit to their business relationship but receives no response.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Frank Liesenborgs. A mute John Doe with the mental capacity of a five-year-old is released from a mental hospital when the state cannot afford his treatment. He begins living on the streets and taking direction from whomever he comes across. While making a biopic about Billy the Kid, the Producer is incensed that method actor Sir Tom Bingsley refuses to leave his trailer. Since this costs the film time and money, the Producer resorts to using a stand-in. The Producer comes across the John Doe selling oranges on the street and hires him due to the striking resemblance to Bingsley. Meanwhile, Lenny is a struggling publicist who has not been able to maintain one client since moving to L.A. and bribes his way onto studio lots to look for talent. Lenny sees John Doe filming the biopic and misunderstands his name to be ""Latte Pronto"" due to the Producer demanding coffee. After Bingsley dies in a misguided method acting technique of hanging himself, ""Billy the Kid"" is forced to continue filming with Pronto as the star. Although hindered by Pronto's lack of acting talent and his continued looks directly into camera, his co-stars Christiana Dior and Chad Luxt are inspired by the supposed avant-garde performance and emulate his acting style. Lenny plans to propel Latte Pronto into stardom by getting him an agent and representation. Pronto is befriended by Luxt taking him to wild parties and showing him the Hollywood lifestyle. Simultaneously, Dior becomes infatuated with Pronto due to his sincerity. Dior convinces Pronto to marry her and they adopt several children, increasing their profiles in the media. ""Billy the Kid"" is a massive success, with critics praising Pronto's performance of breaking the fourth wall by looking into camera. At the after party, Lenny asks Pronto to confirm they will never end their business relationship. When Pronto cannot respond to Lenny's request, a security guard tries to escort Lenny out for disrupting the party. A fight breaks out with Pronto being blamed and sued by the security guard. The Agent asks Pronto to lay low from the media, while informing him of an offer to star in ""Mosquito Boy"" directed by Lex Tanner. While filming ""Mosquito Boy"", Pronto is taken out by Luxt for a night on the town which ends with the two in jail after assaulting a paparazzo. Even though Luxt was the aggressor, Pronto is blamed in the media. This further strains his relationship with his representation. While filming ""Mosquito Boy"", Pronto is injured and a stand-in is used for the majority of the movie. Lenny promises to publicize the film into a big hit regardless. The movie is a colossal failure at the box office and Pronto's representation leaves him. Dior is frustrated with her husband's failing stardom and controversies, so she divorces him, takes the children, and begins dating Luxt. Pronto is forced to move in with Lenny and the two bond over their mutual hardships. Lenny has a heart attack following his consumption of dozens of energy drinks. Pronto stays by his hospital bedside but leaves the room when a fan wants a selfie. Due to a mix-up with a nurse and a deceased patient, Pronto believes Lenny died while Lenny believes Pronto abandoned him. Lenny resolves to become a better person and successful publicist. Meanwhile, Pronto goes back to living on the street. Pronto befriends a homeless man named Dagger and saves his life, gaining media acclaim and is awarded the Key to the City by the Mayor of Los Angeles. The Mayor privately encourages Pronto to run for office on an anti-corporate platform since his acting career is over. The rich and powerful Cote brothers have Pronto kidnapped to discourage his political career. Ed Cote threatens his life should he oppose any of the Cotes' business interests. In return for abandoning politics, Ed Cote arranges for Latte to get his representation back (minus Lenny) and another chance at a movie career. Disillusioned with filmmaking, Pronto abandons his representation and wanders the streets aimlessly. Lenny sees Pronto and chases after him. Lenny apologizes for using his friend as a meal ticket and tells Pronto he loves him. Saying his first words, Pronto responds, ""I love you too."" The two leave to get dinner together and catch up.",comedy,"[[[248 224  26]

76,tt10618286,"1930s Hollywood is re-evaluated through the eyes of scathing social critic and alcoholic screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz as he races to finish the screenplay of Citizen Kane (1941). In 1940, film studio RKO 1940 hires 24-year-old wunderkind Orson Welles under a contract that gives him full creative control of his movies. For his first film, he calls in washed-up alcoholic Herman J. Mankiewicz to write the screenplay. That film is ""Citizen Kane,"" and this is the story of how it was written. Holed up in the secluded North Verde Ranch in the middle of the Mojave Desert, bedridden American screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz has 60 short days to turn in the first draft of the Citizen Kane (1941) screenplay. Grappling with alcohol addiction, Herman J. Mankiewicz collaborates with Orson Welles, Hollywood's 24-year-old golden boy, and gets to work. As RKO had already given Orson Welles carte blanche, Herman J. Mankiewicz decides to draw inspiration from his days working for MGM, his friendship with newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, and Hearst's 20-year-old girlfriend, actress Marion Davies of the Ziegfeld Follies. Mank captures the life of Mankiewicz between essentially 1933 and 1940, when America was in the midst of the Depression and watching uneasily, but from far, the gathering clouds of World War II. There is another presence that Fincher does well to focus on in his telling of the making of Citizen Kane, the candidacy of Left-leaning Upton Sinclair for the governorship of California, which sees the tinsel town gang up against him. As Sinclair is portrayed as promoting ""anti-American"" values, with MGM lending its might to a campaign that would now be described as fake news, Mank is forced to confront his own compromises and little lies.In a marvelous scene, Dance's Hearst recounts Oldman's Mank the ""parable of the organ grinder's monkey"", just after the latter has humiliated himself and Hearst in a drunken rant about the sold idealism of the newspaper baron. While the monkey thinks it is him running the show, Hearst reminds Mank, he has to ""dance"", ""every time"", the music plays.That realization is a glimpse of the bitterness that would eventually lead Mank to finding himself jobless in Hollywood, particularly after his decision to take on Hearst with Welles backing. It would also lead him to Citizen Kane - while on the bed with a broken leg, awayfrom friends and family and fighting for a drink despite alcohol slowly claiming him - as wellas his only Oscar.As Mank explains it to a friend, ""We have got a huge responsibility, to people in the dark willingly checking their disbelief at the door.",comedy,"[[[13 13 13]

80,tt15891388,"Anvitha Ravali Shetty is a 38 year old single independent woman working as a master chef in the United Kingdom living with her single mother. Her mother has very less time left to live as she suffers from an unknown illness so she keeps convincing her daughter to get married soon. Anvitha who is very adamant, doesn't believe in marriage and love due to her parents' failed marriage and hence chooses to be single for the rest of her life. Later, her mother requests her to take her back to India as she wants to spend her last days there. Eventually after a few months her mother dies and Anvitha starts feeling lonely. As she doesn't believe in marriage, she tries to become a mother through IUI, as she feels she too needs a person during her last days. She feels that, like her mother, she doesn't need any man to love her throughout her life and instead, her own biological child can be her supporter throughout her life just like she had her mother. With the help of her friend Kavya, they visit a fertilization center to get pregnant. Anvitha learns the norms and comes to know that random males are taken as donors, which concerns her. She tries to choose her sperm donor through interviewing other men. Anvitha as clear as she is, writes down all the qualities she needs in her donor. Finally, she meets Siddhu Polishetty who is a 33 year old guy doing stand up comedy in one restaurant. She is impressed with him at first sight and tries to talk to him about her intention, but Kavya stops her stating it might make him awkward, so she requests her to take it slow and know more about his habits and personality first. Anvitha gets convinced and gives her visiting card to him to meet her. After a few meetings both get along pretty quick and gradually Siddhu catches feelings for Anvitha, not knowing her actual intention. One day, Siddhu tries to propose her but it backfires when Anvitha reveals the real reason why she wanted him. The concept of getting pregnant without getting married stuns Siddhu and he gets disturbed. Siddhu and his friend, Rahul go to a coffee shop where he unexpectedly sees Anvitha taking to another guy. This enrages him and he intervenes between them and causes a scene. Siddhu, who is now unable to let Anvitha go and unable to accept the fact that Anvitha is going to be with another man if he doesn't help her, later decides to help Anvitha. He goes to her house and begs for forgiveness and asks her to consider him. Siddhu mistakenly believes that Anvita will conceive by the old fashioned method of intercourse, as he doesn't know the general procedure for sperm donation. Later, Siddhu is shocked to know when Anvitha tells him that it is not the usual process of intercourse and instead it is IUI which they have to follow. He is shocked but agrees to the procedure stating that he wants everything she has to be from him. He undergoes vigorous diet and exercise which is monitored by her and the doctor. Siddhu gets frustrated in the process and gets drunk. This enrages Anvitha and begs him to not to do the work if he is uninterested and confesses that she doesn't have feelings. She also tells him that she doesn't believe in love and marriage because of her parents's divorce which happened when she was 6. Siddhu realizes his mistake and resumes his dieting. One day the procedure date is fixed and according to the contract the donor should not involve into her personal life and shouldn't contact her after the procedure otherwise legal action shall be taken. This breaks Siddhu even more and he bids farewell to Anvitha asking her a favor. He further requests Anvita to tell her daughter or son that their father was a person who genuinely loved her instead of just some random sperm donor when they inevitably ask who their father was. Later Anvitha gets her results positive in her pregnancy test and goes to share the news with Siddhu but Rahul stops her by saying even she shouldn't interfere in his life as and when she wants as he is just healing from their separation since Siddhu too can't, according to the contract and asks her to leave him. Anvitha, heartbroken leaves India. While she returns to UK, she is disturbed due to Siddhu's absence and decides she needs a change of place. She moves to country side somewhere in UK and starts spending time there. Meanwhile, Siddhu successfully gives frequent stand ups and gains popularity. His father gets to know about his feelings and asks him to give assurance to Anvitha that he is beside her through thick and thin as she is scared of getting left out in a relationship. Siddhu travels every corner of UK to get to know about her. But, in the end finally meets her at the hospital at the time of her delivery and tries to talk to her, he is stopped by the staff stating only her partner can enter the labor room. Anvitha recognizes his voice and replies he is the father of the child and this moves Siddhu. He sees his name in the medical form as the father. Finally blessed with a baby the movies ends with Siddhu doing a stand up where he reveals he is married to Anvitha and leaves the stage saying he needs to change his daughter's diaper.",romance,"[[[118  41 179]

He contacts his estranged artist/painter dad, Robert, and they drive down to Tuscany, Italy, to fix up and sell the country house inherited from their late wife/mom (car accident). Jack hasn't been there since he was 7 and it hasn't been used the following 20 years or so. It has a fantastic view but is in dire need of repair and paint if they want to sell it. Jack heads to the nearest town and meets cute, single divorcee Natalia, who owns and runs a restaurant there. The movie opens in Flite Gallery, an art gallery in London, managed by Jack (MicheÃƒÂ¡l Richardson, Liam Neeson's real life son) but owned by Ruth (Yolanda Kettle) Jack's estranged wife and her family. Ruth tells Jack that her family is selling the gallery and seeing as how he put great effort but never any money in it, he has no say or input in this decision. Jack says that he and his father can sell the Italian house and that with that, he'll buy the gallery. Jack goes to his father, Robert (Liam Neeson), a true bohemian artist, whose London flat is also his studio, first thing in the morning, to tell him that they have to sell the house in Italy. Robert comes out of his bedroom wrapped in a robe, with a scruffy beard and mustache and as he is talking to Jack, a woman comes out of the bedroom, fully clothed. Robert introduces the woman to Jack but calls her by a different name. She curses him and storms out. Jack, not yet having told his father that he and his wife, Ruth, are divorcing, insists they go to the Italian house and just sell it.

An unseen older woman tells the story of her father, Elmer Elevator Jacob Tremblay, when he was a kid. He and his mother Dela Golshifteh Farahani owned a candy shop in a small town, but were soon forced to close down and move away when the people of the town moved away. They move to a farawa city where they plan to open a new shop, but they eventually lose all the money they save up while getting by. Dela struggles to find work in the city and is barely able to afford her weekly rent payments to Mrs. McClaren Rita Moreno.Elmer soon befriends a cat Whoopi Goldberg and eventually gets the idea to panhandle the money needed for the store, only for his mother to tell him that it is a lost cause. Angered, Elmer runs to the docks to be alone. The Cat comes to him and begins speaking to him, much to his shock. She tells him that on an island, Wild Island, beyond the city lies a dragon that can probably help him. Elmer takes the task and is transported to the island thanks to a bubbly whale named Soda Judy Greer. Once they make it to Wild Island, Soda explains that a gorilla named Saiwa Ian McShane is using the dragon to keep the island from sinking, but it remains ineffective. The Island continues to sink and needs more and more frequent effort from Boris to pull it back up from the ocean.Elmer frees the dragon, a goof ball named Boris Gaten Matarazzo, and they go on an adventure in search of a tortoise named Aratuah to find out how Boris can keep the island from sinking for the next century. Boris explains that his kind has been saving the island as long as anyone can remember, and after he succeeds, he will be an ""After Dragon"". Dragons have been coming to wild island forever as a rite of passage. when Dragons are  yrs old  in human yrs, they come to the island and save it from sinking coz the island sinks every  yrs, and this turns them into a After Dragon, more muscular, fire breathing and basically awesome. Boris knows that the way he is saving the Island is not the right way, as he hasn't turned into the After Dragon yet. Boris has no idea how to save the Island the right way, and believes that Aratuah would know since he was around when the last dragon Horatio came to save it.During this conversation, it is discovered that Boris cannot fly due to breaking his wing when Elmer saved him They were chased by Saiwa's nd in command Kwan who threw a fire torch at them and ended up hitting Boris's wing, injuring him, and he reveals that he is afraid of both water and fire. The two make an agreement that Boris will help Elmer raise enough cash to buy a new store and will let the dragon go free once finished. Along the way, they encounter some of the islands inhabitants, like Cornelius the crocodile Alan Cumming, the tiger siblings Sasha Leighton Meester and George Spence Moore II The tigers want to eat Elmer, as he is soft and sweet. He only escapes by making them fight over a cinnamon flavored bubble gum and a mother rhino named Iris Dianne Wiest she fell into a trap with her baby rhino and wasn't able to climb out. Elmer fell into the same trap all while trying to evade Saiwa and his monkey army. Elmer explains to Iris that he is taking Boris to Aratuah to find out how to save the Island for real. When Saiwa arrives, Iris helps hide Boris and Elmer and tells Saiwa that they went towards the summit if the Island.nAs Boris and Elmer make their way to Aratuah, the island continues to sink gradually. Kwan almost captures Boris, but Saiwa makes him let go, as he wants Kwan to save the monkeys from the incoming sea. Saiwa tells Kwan that one day he will lead the monkeys, and he has to learn to not abandon them, ever. They still have time to capture the dragon and save the island.They soon make it to Aratuah's shell, but Elmer finds out that he died, and leave as the island continues to sink. While resting on a flower, they are found by Saiwa and his forces. When Boris tries to escapes, Saiwa captures him by his injured wing, fixing it inadvertently in the process. Boris flies away with Elmer. Saiwa reveals that he knew about Aratuah's death, which angers his macaque ndincommand Kwan Chris O'Dowd, who proceeds to use a giant mushroom as a raft to leave the island, convinced that it is hopeless to save. While flying with Boris, Elmer has an epiphany; it is the roots below the island that pull it down. He manages to convince Boris to fly with all his might and while Boris manages to free the island from two of the roots, he then realizes that this is still the wrong way to save the island. He knows he has to jump into the summit fire to save it. But Elmer is not convinced and keeps telling him not to. Boris pushes Elmer off, who falls off the Island and into the water.Elmer is saved by Saiwa, who reveals that he and the other animals are evacuating the island and berates Elmer for wanting to use Boris for his own merits. He then reveals that once he found out about Aratuah's death, he was frightened about making everyone more worried and was even more worried when Boris showed up to save the island but Saiwa was weary of his goofy personality, so he lied and said he knew how to control Boris. Wanting to fix things, Elmer goes back to the island where Boris tells him he has found a way to save it by jumping into the fire at the summit of the Island and eventually after a lot of encouragement from Elmer he jumps in, he bursts out and magically lifts the island from the sea, finally becoming an After Dragon.After telling the animals of the island how to always let future dragons know the right way to save it, Boris takes Elmer home, passing by a surprised Kwan residing over on tangerine trees. Elmer reunites with his mother and the film ends with him embracing his new life in the city with his daughter narrating the end of the story.'",comedy,"[[[ 9 18 15]

When Gemma suddenly becomes the caretaker of her orphaned yearold niece, Cady, Gemma's unsure and unprepared to be a parent. Under intense pressure at work, Gemma decides to pair her MGAN prototype with Cady in an attempt to resolve both problemsa decision that will have unimaginable consequences. Following a freak accident, orphaned yearold Cady is sent to live with Aunt Gemma, a brilliant, careerdriven roboticist. But new beginnings are always challenging. As a result, forced to make a pivotal decision under deadline pressure, Gemma puts forward her pioneering, secret MGAN project an imperfect, lifelike android. And as the risky decision proves to be a lifesaver, the traumatised girl develops a profound bond with the machine, redefining the meaning of family and friendship. The film starts with a commercial for ""Purrpetual Petz,"" furry dolls made by the toy company Funki. Although crude and creepylooking, they are advertised as being perfect companions for children. We then see Cady James Violet McGraw playing with one of her Petz, which annoys her parents, Ryan Arlo Green and Nicole Kira Josephson. They are on their way to a ski trip, but the roads are slippery and hard to see. Just as Ryan stops for a moment, the family's car is rammed into by a snowplow, killing Ryan and Nicole.Elsewhere, Nicole's sister Gemma Allison Williams works at Funki and is developing a new robot doll with her coworkers Tess Jen Van Epps and Cole Brian Jordan Alvarez. However, their boss, David Lin Ronny Chieng, wants them to develop a cheaper version of the Purrpetual Petz since their rival companies are coming out with their own toys similar to the Petz for cheaper than what the Petz already cost. The three try to put on a silicone face and run tests, but the robot has a slight glitch where she is smirking when she is supposed to look confused. David comes in with his assistant Kurt Stephane GarneauMonten to chew the three out until Gemma explains her project to him. The robot, MGAN voice of Jenna Davis Model  Generative Android, is meant to be so advanced that she cannot be replicated. Unfortunately, while running a demonstration for David, Cole realizes he forgot to add the polypropylene barrier to MGAN, causing her to explode. David orders the three to have a new Petz pitch in time, and Gemma gets a call from the hospital.After learning of her sister's death, Gemma becomes Cady's temporary legal guardian. When they return home, Gemma has to deal with her neighbor Celia Lori Dungey and her obnoxious dog Dewey, who keeps running onto Gemma's lawn since there is a hole in the fence.

Siblings, Gretel and Hansel live in the countryside with their mother. When times are hard and Gretel can't find work, their mother sends them out to fend for themselves. As they journey through the dark forest without clothes nor supplies, they come upon a house with good-smelling food, and decide to temporarily stay there in care of an old woman.

Her father took her to see an enchantress, who removed the illness but left a power within the girl. As she grew older, people in the village went to the girl, as she had premonitions of the future. Since she knew everything ended in death, she used her power to kill people, including her father. The child was taken into the woods to be left alone, but she lured other children her way to a grim fate.Teenaged Gretel (Sophia Lillis) and her younger brother Hansel (Sam Leakey) are going to meet a man about a job as a housekeeper.

She tells Gretel that she and Hansel must leave since there is no room left in the house. The mother goes as far as threatening to hack Gretel to bits if they don't leave immediately.The siblings flee their home and find a hut to sleep in for the night. They then find a ghoulish man who lets out a horrible scream and makes the kids run away. He chases them outside and attacks Hansel. Gretel punches the man, whose eye appears to come off.

101,tt3915174,"When Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll and he has burned through eight of his nine lives, he launches an epic journey to restore them by finding the mythical Last Wish. Sadly, Puss in Boots, the undaunted Spanish lover and hero, is now down to the last of his nine lives, a decade after the events of Puss in Boots (2011). And as if that weren't enough, the unstoppable bounty hunter known as The Big Bad Wolf is after him. To restore all of his precious lives and escape an inglorious fate, Puss must pluck up his courage to embark on a dangerous quest into the Dark Forest to find the legendary Wishing Star. However, Puss isn't the only one seeking the map to the magical star. As the daring outlaw puts his skills to good use to stay one step ahead of formidable adversaries determined to get their hands on it, a crucial question arises: Does he have what it takes to face his most skilled and terrifying opponent and get his life back on track?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas. The wishing star fell on Earth many eons ago and created the dark black forest where it fell. It gave new life to the forest. The star has the legend of a single wish locked away in it, waiting to be granted.While hosting a party in the town of Del Mar, legendary hero and outlaw Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) accidentally awakens a sleeping giant. He subdues the creature but is crushed by a bell. Waking up in a hospital, the town doctor (Anthony Mendez) informs him that he has lost eight of his nine lives and suggests Puss should retire. That night in a bar, Puss meets a black-hooded wolf (Wagner Moura), who disarms and wounds him in a sword-fight. Puss is not able to mount any resistance to the Wolf and is scared for the first time in his lifeTraumatized, Puss flees to the house of cat lady Mama Luna (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), where he buries his clothes and meets an optimistic Chihuahua disguised as a cat whom he calls Perrito (Harvey GuillÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©n) (a friendly and naive therapy dog who started out as one of Mama Luna's pet cats). Puss is bored by the sedated lifestyle at Mama Luna's. He shares the place with many many other cats and has no identity left what-so-ever.Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her Three Bears Crime Family (Mama Bear (Olivia Colman), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone) & baby bear (Samson Kayo)) soon arrive at Luna's home. They plan to hire Puss to steal a map bearing the Wishing Star's location from pastry chef and crime boss ""Big"" Jack Horner (John Mulaney), but fail to recognize Puss in Boots and leave after finding his ""grave"" (where Puss had buried his clothes and sword). Puus overhears Goldi talking about the map to the Wishing Star and that the map will be with Big Jack Horner.Horner, a feared pastry chef and crime lord who plans to use the Wishing Star to gain control of all magicPuss decides to use the Star to restore his lost lives. Accompanied by Perrito, he breaks into Horner's bakery to steal the map, but is interrupted by his resentful ex-fiance Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) (a street-savvy Tuxedo cat who is Puss' ex-fiance, and seeks the Wishing Star to find somebody she can trust), Horner, and Goldi and the bears. Puss manages to escape with the map alongside Kitty and Perrito, though he sees the wolf threaten him while fleeing.The map leads the trio to the Dark Forest, a pocket dimension that changes its landscape depending on the map's holder. Puss and Kitty get the path with the most deadly obstacles, but Perrito's path is littered with rainbows and rivers of relaxation. Puss and Kitty hand the map to Perrito.Meanwhile the bears, Goldi and Horner are in pursuit of the trio. At the Pocket Full of Posies, giant roses block their path. Perrito gets them through by simply smelling the roses. Horner follows and uses his Phoenix to burn the entire rose meadow down.During another clash with Horner, his henchmen, and Goldi and the bears, Puss sees the wolf again and runs off, distracting Kitty and allowing Goldi to obtain the map. After Perrito calms Puss' panic attack, Puss confesses to being on his last life, and his remorse for leaving Kitty on their wedding day. Kitty overhears them and reveals that she never attended the wedding either, believing Puss could not love anyone more than himself.Puss and Kitty steal back the map while Goldi and the bears are distracted by a manifestation of their woodland cottage where Goldi and the bears first met (Goldi's path went through Nostalgic Pines). As the dimension shifts, Puss accidentally traps himself in a crystalline cave (In the Caves of Lost Souls), where he encounters his arrogant past lives, and the wolf, who reveals himself as Death. The black hooded wolf is initially presumed to be a bounty hunter. He wants to personally kill Puss as punishment for Puss wasting eight of his nine lives. He wields twin sickles that combine into a double-bladed weapon.Feeling disrespected by Puss not valuing his extra lives, Death wants to take Puss' final life prematurely. Horrified, Puss runs out of the cave towards the Star alone, ignoring Kitty and Perrito's pleas for him to stop. Kitty feels that Puss has again betrayed her.Meanwhile, Goldi reveals to the bears that her wish is to be reunited with her biological family; although they are devastated, the bears agree to help her.Puss arrives at the Star and begins to make his wish using the map, but is confronted by Kitty, who berates him for his selfishness and confesses that her wish was to find someone she could trust. Goldi, the bears, and Horner arrive, and a fight ensues for the map; Goldi briefly obtains the map, but abandons it to save Baby Bear, while Kitty traps Horner inside his magical bottomless bag. Death mounts the Star and challenges Puss. Having learned the value of life from his time with his companions, Puss forgoes wishing for more lives and accepts Death's duel. Puss disarms the wolf, and declares that while he knows he can never defeat Death, he will never stop fighting for his last life. Seeing that Puss has lost his arrogance, Death begrudgingly spares him. Before leaving, Death and Puss agree they will meet again one day.Horner eats a magic snack inside the bag, which makes him gigantic and allows him to escape. He attempts to make his wish to control all of the world's magic for himself, but Perrito distracts him long enough for Puss, Kitty, and Goldi to destroy the map, causing the Star to collapse and consume Horner. In the aftermath, Goldi affirms to the bears that they are her true family, and they leave to take over Horner's bakery. Puss rekindles his romance with Kitty; the two and Perrito later steal a ship and set sail to the Kingdom of Far Far Away.']",comedy,"[[[  0   0   0]

109,tt0870154,"Based on Disneyland's theme park ride where a small riverboat takes a group of travelers through a jungle filled with dangerous animals and reptiles but with a supernatural element. Dreaming about saving countless lives and having another adventure, the feisty English feminist and doctor of botany, Dr Lily Houghton, embarks on a peril-laden mission to change the world. Along with her fashionable brother, MacGregor, Dr Houghton enlists the help of the arrogant, wisecracking riverboat skipper, Captain Frank Wolff, to guide them through the serpentine Amazon River in La Quila, his swift wooden boat. Now, as the intrepid trio ventures deeper and deeper into the heart of an impenetrable green maze, searching for something that cannot be found, a centuries-old curse and the ruthless aristocrat, Prince Joachim, threaten to put an end to their ambitious plans. And, sooner or later, the jungle always wins. Is it true that the Spanish conquistador, Don Aguirre, was lost in the same God-forsaken part of the world? In the 16th century, Spanish conquistadors travel to South America in search of the Tears of the Moon, a mythical tree whose petals can cure any illness, heal any injury, and lift any curse. After most of the men die in the jungle, the survivors are nursed back to health by a local tribe using the tree petals. When they refuse to reveal the location of the tree, the Spanish destroy the village, and as punishment are cursed to never die and never be able to leave sight of the river.In 1916, Dr. Lily Houghton and her brother MacGregor detail Lily's research on the Tears of the Moon to an association of English explorers, explaining that the petals could revitalize medicine and aid in the war effort. The Houghton's request access to an arrowhead recovered by Dr. Albert Falls that Lily believes is key to locating the tree. When the association denies their request, believing the tree to be a myth and a female scientist unqualified to join their ranks, Lily steals the arrowhead instead. She narrowly avoids Prince Joachim, a German aristocrat who also wants the arrowhead and the tree.In South America, Frank Wolff takes tourists on jungle river cruises, which he embellishes with fake dangers and corny jokes. When his boat engine is repossessed by businessman Nilo, he attempts to steal it back. Caught in the act by Lily, Frank pretends to be Nilo and arrogantly tells her that the Tears of the Moon is a myth and that she will not be able to handle the dangers of the jungle, but changes his tone when he notices that Lily is in possession of the arrowhead.",action,"[[[14  5  8]

Aspiring actor Sam and his botanist girlfriend Rylie have travelled to rural New England to investigate an outbreak of an ergottype fungus called ""sordico"" that has been devastating local farms. They camp on a remote farm after their car breaks down, but elderly farmer Eulis, claiming to be the landowner, asks the couple to leave. Sam and Rylie return to their car to discover its battery died, leaving them stranded. They look for help at a nearby farmhouse and meet Karen, an eccentric old woman, and her supposed son Gunni, who is mute, partially catatonic, constantly watching vintage cartoons, and wears bandages around his head. Karen explains Gunni's bizarre behavior by claiming a bull kicked him in the head.Karen supposedly calls a mechanic named Pete to come and jumpstart the couple's car. While waiting, she feeds Sam and Rylie strange food that conflicts with their strict vegan diet, while also engaging in odd conversation, which includes Rylie asking about weird Polaroids of Karen's family. When Pete fails to show up, Karen sets up Sam and Rylie with sleeping arrangements in the cellar. Addicted after years of maintaining his diet, Sam leaves Rylie alone to gorge on more of Karen's food in the kitchen, and Gunni experiences a seizure while seemingly trying to say something to Sam.

118,tt8637498,"Inspired by an epic Chinese tale, translated into an action-packed comedy, a Monkey and his magical fighting Stick battle demons, dragons, gods and the greatest adversary of all - Monkey's ego. THE MONKEY KING is an action-packed family comedy that follows a charismatic Monkey and his magical fighting Stick on an epic quest for victory over 100 demons, an eccentric Dragon King, and Monkey's greatest foe of all -his own ego. Along the way, a young village girl challenges his self-centered attitude and shows him that even the smallest pebble can have a big effect on the world. One night, a monkey (Dee Bradley Baker) is born from a stone atop a tall mountain and disturbs the Jade Emperor (Hoon Lee). Just as the Emperor gives the order to eliminate the cub, Buddha (BD Wong) appears before him and tells him to let him find his purpose. Jade Emperor is the ruler of Heavens, while Buddha is the guiding light of the entire Universe.Monkey finds a troop of other monkeys, but his unruly nature keeps him from fitting in. One of his escapades causes a feared demon to pounce from his mountain lair and grab one of the troop's cubs for food; as a result, Monkey is banished. To prove his worth to the troop, he trains to fight the demon. After many years, when he deems himself ready, he confronts the demon, but his training proves ineffective, and another cub is snatched. To fetch a more suitable weapon, Monkey dives into the sea realm of the Dragon King (Bowen Yang), where he finds the latter gloating over a glowing column which he means to use to eradicate all life on the world's surface. Communicating with the column, Monkey turns it into a staff and escapes.With the staff in hand, Monkey returns to the demon's lair, defeats him, and rescues the cub. Then he crowns himself King of the Monkeys (Jimmy O. Yang). The troop's elder (James Sie) cautions that his staff should only be used by the gods. The new Monkey King decides to kill 100 demons, thus gaining the right to enter the Heavens and become a god. The Monkey King travels all over the world and kills 99 demons.Eventually, he comes to a village terrorized by the Red Girl. With the endorsement of a girl named Lin (Jolie Hoang-Rappaport), Monkey King defeats Red Girl, and Lin pledges herself as his assistant. But despite the 100 demons vanquished, the Immortal Ones do not descend from heaven to welcome the Monkey King to their realm. The Dragon King emerges from the nearby sea during the victory celebration to reclaim his prized weapon. The Dragon King cannot stay outside of water very long. After fighting him and retaining the stick, Monkey King leaves the village; Lin tags along, even though he treats her condescendingly. Unknown to him, Lin is an agent of the Dragon King to help him reclaim the staff in return for saving her drought-stricken village.The stick tells The Monkey King that to become an Immortal, he needs immortality. The Monkey King needs Lin as he cannot read.The duo reaches a graveyard, where Monkey King opens a portal to Hell to get to the Archive of Souls and strike his name off his Scroll of Life and Death, thus gaining immortality. King Yama (Andrew Kishino), the ruler and chief judge of Hell, recognizes them as outsiders and fights them. With Lin's help, Monkey King succeeds in erasing his name, but is only made ageless. He steals Yama's Book of Everlasting Life and learns that he must eat a peach from the Orchard of Everlasting Life to gain full immortality. The Dragon King subtly guides Monkey King and Lin to a peach tree laced with an intoxicating poison, but accidentally ends up eating one himself and running off.After realizing that the peaches are fake, Monkey King learns from the book that Wangmu (Jodi Long), the divine Queen Mother, brews an immortality elixir for the gods. He and Lin infiltrate the Jade Palace's pharmacy to create a sample of the elixir. Wangmu catches them in the act and attacks them, but Monkey King succeeds in consuming the potion, thus becoming fully immortal. Although Lin has several chances to steal the staff, she repeatedly returns to help Monkey King. Monkey King also demonstrates that despite his rude behavior, he cares about her too. Monkey King and Lin flee the Heavens, and in a following heart-to-heart, Lin admits that she longs to make a difference in the world and tries to encourage Monkey King to do the same. The Monkey King refuses to part with his stick to help Lin with her village.When Monkey King remains aloof and boisterous, Lin outwits him and delivers the staff to the Dragon King. As soon as he has it, the Dragon King reneges on his deal and prepares to drown the world in a mega-storm, but Monkey King challenges and attacks him. Realizing her mistake, Lin tricks the Dragon King into blasting Monkey King with lightning, thus making him stronger and enabling him to beat the Dragon King. However, Monkey King becomes power-drunk and attacks the Heaven itself. Buddha prepares to intervene, but Lin wants to give Monkey King another chance. Acting as Buddha's voice, Lin challenges the Monkey King to leap off Buddha's hand to win ruler-ship over Heaven, or suffer a period of penance if he fails. Monkey King fails as the entire Universe resides on Buddha's palm. The Monkey King is imprisoned in a mountain. Before the mountain is fully closed off, Lin is allowed to say goodbye to Monkey King, who finally admits how important Lin has become to him, and leaves him his staff for company.Five hundred years later, an enlightened Monkey King is freed from his prison by a monk, a pig, and a river spirit at Buddha's behest. They invite him to join them on a journey to the West, to which he happily agrees.",comedy,"[[[112  60  36]

126,tt9619798,"Tim (David Spade) has a blind date with Melissa (Lauren Lapkus), nicknamed Missy. Missy is extremely strange, and her odd behavior turns out to be disastrous for Tim. Missy texts Tim as he enters the bar saying that she is a woman in a blue dress, with a meat-head (Joe ""Roman Reigns"" Anoai) hitting on her. Tim interjects and tries to save the woman, who is pregnant. But turns out that the woman in the blue dress was actually the wife and Missy was using this antic as an ice breaker with Tim. She calls Tim old, and calls out his blonde wig. Tim doesn't drink and Missy is a bit of an alcoholic. She was set up by Tim's grandmother. Missy picks a loud fight with the husband of the woman in the blue dress, claiming he was staring at her (ogling her).. She flashes him a huge knife and is asked to leave the restaurant. Her wild antics result in Tim sneaking out of the restaurant through a window and subsequently dislocating his ankle.

Three months later, Tim's company (Credit Of America) is going through a merger and roles are being re-assigned. Julia (Sarah Chalke) is Tim's ex-fiance is dating Rich (Chris Witaske), who is Tim's colleague. So, as a significant other, she is invited to the company retreat in a few days. Nate (Nick Swardson) is the head of HR and has hacked all of TIm's passwords and knows everything about Tim's personal life.

Tim meets a beautiful woman, also named Melissa (Molly Sims), at an airport. They connect with much in common and seem to be perfect for each other (They read the same books, they both don't drink). She ends up giving him her number. He begins texting her (including dick pics) and eventually invites her to his work retreat in Hawaii. However, on the plane, Missy shows up, and Tim realizes he had been texting the wrong Melissa. She says that she was about to jump off a bridge when Tim texted her (Tim assumes she was going to commit suicide, but Missy was just about to go bungee jumping). Missy drugs Tim, forcibly giving him a tranquilizer and he awakens later on the plane to her sexual assaulting him by giving him a hand-job.

At the hotel, Missy picks up a fight with kids about riding sea turtles. Tim tells Nate about his messed up by texting the whole Melissa this entire time. In Hawaii, Jack Winstone (Geoff Pierson), the new CEO, welcomes everyone. Nate has already bragged to Winstone about the 2nd Melissa who is apparently Miss Maryland and a total hottie. Winstone is eager to meet her, while Tim is anxious not to reveal the truth to Winstone. Tim tells Missy about the brags and asks her to cooperate. Missy is awkward and wild (she give fortuneteller readings to the entire company) and always seems to end up leaving Tim in embarrassing situations (she dances awkwardly on stage in front of everyone, dry humps Tim, bites him, throws food around) in front of his boss and colleagues. Missy gets super drunk and attempts to jump off a cliff, only to mistime her jump and tumbling her way down and landing face first on the beach. At the hotel, he awakens to her on top of him, sexually assaulting him in his sleep. She often becomes reckless and intoxicated and her behavior results in humiliation for Tim.

Winstone takes the team for a shark tank dive off the coast with guide Komante (Rob Schneider), who has lost 3 fingers to shark bite. Missy forces her way onto the boat by jumping out, while Tim wanted the boat to leave without her. Once out in the ocean, she forces Tim to enter the cage with Winstone, even though Tim tried hard not to participate by saying he needed to take care of a sick Missy. Then Missy chops up some fish bits and throws them in the water to attract the sharks. A great white comes swimming and attacks the cage really hard. The cage breaks and the shark gets in. In the panic Tim breaks Winstone's nose. Komante punches the shark in the nose to make it go away. Missy administers CPR to Winstone to revive him after he swallows too much water in his lungs.

Back at the room, TIm asks Missy to not venture out. Missy decides to spend time with Barbara (Arlene Newman) (staying in the room next door), who heard Tim & Missy have sex the night before. Barbara told her that her husband didn't make those noises since their honeymoon 30 yrs ago. Missy decides to go to a spa with Barbara. When Tim narrates this to Nate, he is horrified, since Barbara is Winstone's wife. TIm rushes back only to find that Missy had advised Barbara to break up with Winstone. Winstone finds out that Missy meddled in his marriage and in his rage he trips over and hurts his neck. Missy snaps his neck back into position and tells Winstone that he is responsible for the marriage falling apart.

As time goes on, she starts to help Tim do well at his work retreat and also wins Winstone's favor towards Tim by hypnotizing him (she spent the whole night with Barbara and Winstone and used that opportunity to Hynotize him). At the talent show Tim's team puts in a really lousy performance but Winstone applauds Tim and keeps saying ""I Love that guy"". Tim asks Missy and she admits that she hypnotized him. Tim eventually begins to fall for her. Throughout Janice can see how much fun Missy is having and the laughs she shares with Tim. Janice reaches out to Missy, who convinces her to have a threesome with her and Tim Tim's workplace competitor, Jess (Jackie Sandler) ('The Barracuda'), is not pleased with Winstone giving a job to Tim instead of her. So Jess reveals to Missy that she was invited there by accident and wasn't the one Tim wanted to invite. Missy checks Tim's phone and finds out the truth. Saddened and devastated, she leaves Hawaii.

Meanwhile, the actual Melissa arrives in Hawaii, having been invited by Jess. At lunch, Tim begins acting much like Missy did on their first date, taking multiple shots and performing a handstand in the diner. Tim lets her know that he has feelings for someone else and leaves Hawaii for Portland. Tim also removes the hypnotism Missy put on Winstone, and Tim ends up quitting his job. Tim meets with Missy and he apologizes and tells her all the things that he likes about her and that he wants to be more like her. She forgives him, and they kiss.",romance,"[[[231 233 228]

Josh's stepmother and father eventually find out about Lyle, and though initially terrified of him, bond with Lyle over their favorite hobbies. One day, Hector returns to the house to visit Lyle, as an agreement states he can live in the house fifteen days a year. He makes another attempt to get Lyle to perform on stage, but it fails as Lyle still has stage fright, apart from when performing for the Primms. Meanwhile, Alistair Grumps, the Primms' unfriendly downstairs neighbor, becomes annoyed by the loud activity caused by Lyle, Hector, and the Primms. Determined to put an end to it, he has cameras installed to discover what is happening but manages to achieve his goal by bribing Hector to sell out Lyle in exchange for money to pay his debts. Lyle cannot convince the authorities of his benevolent nature because of his stage fright and is locked up at the zoo. Feeling guilty for what he did to Lyle, Hector goes to break him out of the zoo with Josh's help, who was initially unwilling to help after learning Hector sold Lyle out. On Josh's insistence, Hector and Lyle reconcile with each other before Lyle escapes with Josh to the talent show, while Hector distracts the authorities. On stage, Lyle manages to overcome his stage fright with help from Josh, receiving acclaim from the audience and viewers for his singing talent. One month later, a trial is held to determine whether or not Lyle may be free. The judge ultimately decides to rule over Grumps in favor of Lyle when Hector reveals that the deed to his house was written out to his grandmother, that was hidden away under Grumps' bed, who built the house and founded the New York City Zoo where Lyle was previously kept, allowing her to keep exotic animals as pets. After the trial, the Primms celebrate Lyle's freedom, and Grumps' implied eviction, by taking him on vacation, while Hector becomes acquainted with a new talented animal: a beatboxing rattlesnake named Malfoy, owned by Josh's friend, Trudy.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—elwarts. In New York City, a charismatic magician named Hector P. Valenti wants to try out on a national talent show but is constantly rejected. One day after a failed audition, he wanders into an exotic pet store, where he finds a singing baby crocodile and names him Lyle. Seeing Lyle as an opportunity to become rich in the talent business, he places his three-story Victorian brownstone house as collateral for their performance, but Lyle experiences stage fright during the premiere and Hector loses the house. Hector is forced to move out and reluctantly leaves Lyle to fend for himself while he tries to make more money. Eighteen months later, Mr. and Mrs. Primm and their young son Josh move into the house.

Slumberland takes audiences to a magical new place, a dreamworld where precocious Nemo (Marlow Barkley) and her eccentric companion Flip (Jason Momoa) embark on the adventure of a lifetime. After her father Peter (Kyle Chandler) is unexpectedly lost at sea, young Nemo's idyllic Pacific Northwest existence is completely upended when she is sent to live in the city with her well-meaning but deeply awkward uncle Phillip (Chris O'Dowd). Her new school and new routine are challenging by day but at night, a secret map to the fantastical world of Slumberland connects Nemo to Flip, a rough-around-the-edges but lovable outlaw who quickly becomes her partner and guide. She and Flip soon find themselves on an incredible journey traversing dreams and fleeing nightmares, where Nemo begins to hope that she will be reunited with her father once again.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Netflix"", ""Nemo is a young girl who lives in a lighthouse with her father Peter ever since her mom died when she was young. Peter teaches Nemo how to maintain the lighthouse and tells her wild bedtime stories about his adventures with a character named Flip and one of their adventures involve the searching for a cave of magical wish-granting pearls.One day, a storm occurs and Peter heads out to help a distressed boat. Nemo has a nightmare of her underwater as Peter is snatched by a squid-like shape. After Nemo wakes up from her nightmare, Carla informs Nemo that her father is now lost at sea. As a result, Carla contacts Nemo's doorknob salesman uncle Philip and persuades him to take Nemo in before she becomes a ward of the state. Philip is shown to lead a monotonous and unfulfilling life.Nemo is awakened one night when her stuffed pig (named Pig) comes to life, finding herself in Slumberland, the world between dreams. She is carried back to the lighthouse by her animated bed, where she meets Flip, a stubborn and unscrupulous outlaw. Nemo recognizes Flip as the character from the stories her father told. He asks Nemo about a magical map, but she is unaware of it. With no use for Nemo, Flip pushes her off a cliff to wake her up.Awake, Nemo struggles to adjust to her new life and is an outcast at school as she meets school counselor Ms. Arya and a student named Jamal. Nemo then finds the map in the waking world and manages to take it back to Slumberland, where Flip begrudgingly agrees to take her with him to the pearls so she can wish her father into her dreams.Flip tells Nemo that he has refused to wake up for so long he no longer remembers who he was when awake. He uses the map as a guide through various dreams to get to the cave. They travel through multiple dreams of different people and are attacked by a cloud of smoke resembling a kraken, a personification of the nightmare of Nemo's father being taken by the same creature. The duo also find themselves being chased down by Agent Green of the Bureau of Subconscious Activities (BoSA), who wants to imprison Flip for never waking up and intruding dreams. They use more dreams to flee Green, but are eventually caught. Green locks Flip up and warns Nemo that she cannot control her dreams before waking her up.In the waking world, Philip shows Nemo an old video tape of him and Peter as children playing together. Nemo realizes that Flip is Philip's dream alter-ego. As Flip has not woken up, Philip remains docile and unadventurous in the waking world. Nemo borrows Philip's lock-picking tools and goes to Slumberland to rescue Flip from the BoSA. The two use more dreams to flee Green, finding their way back to the lighthouse. Nemo tells Flip who he is, and he rebukes this, stating that he will never wake up. Before she can dive into the ocean to find the pearls, Nemo is awakened and torn out of Slumberland by Ms. Arya.

139,tt11564570,"Tech billionaire Miles Bron invites his friends for a getaway on his private Greek island. When someone turns up dead, Detective Benoit Blanc is put on the case. Five long-time friends are invited to the Greek island home of billionaire Miles Bron. All five know Bron from way back and owe their current wealth, fame, and careers to him. The main event is a murder-weekend game with Bron to be the victim. In reality, they all have reasons to kill him. Also invited is Benoit Blanc, the world's greatest detective.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—grantss. Having planned out an elaborate murder-mystery game down to the last detail, visionary New York City tech billionaire Miles Bron invites his close friends to his private slice of paradise in the Aegean for the weekend. As a mysterious invitation jolts debonair investigator Benoit Blanc into action, the inquisitive master detective sets foot on the sun-kissed Greek isle to rub shoulders with the reclusive host's back-stabbing supporters--because, just like in Knives Out (2019), each has a skeleton in the closet. But in Blanc's eyes, the solution is in plain sight. The question is, can he find the crucial last piece of information before warm, bright-red blood stains Bron's idyllic sanctuary? During the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020, Miles Bron, the billionaire co-founder of the technology company Alpha, decides to host a murder mystery game at his mansion, the Glass Onion, on his private island in Greece. He invites five friends: Alpha head scientist Lionel Toussaint, Connecticut governor Claire Debella, controversial fashion designer Birdie Jay, men's rights streamer Duke Cody, and Alpha cofounder and ousted ex-CEO Cassandra ""Andi"" Brand. Famous detective Benoit Blanc also receives an invitation and joins the group, along with Birdie's assistant Peg and Duke's girlfriend Whiskey. Also present on the island is Miles' friend Derol, who is only staying because he is ""going through some things"" and is not part of the party.Miles questions the presence of Blanc - not invited by him - but allows him to stay, assuming that another guest invited him as a joke. Blanc overhears Peg confront Miles over a PR statement he wants Birdie to release, and sees Duke watch Whiskey in bed with Miles. Before dinner, Miles shows off the Mona Lisa, which he has on loan from the Louvre, and reveals that the Glass Onion is powered by ""Klear"", a hydrogen-based alternative fuel that Alpha will launch in a week, despite Lionel's and Claire's safety concerns.Blanc solves Miles' pretend murder mystery immediately, and tensions over Andi's presence culminate in her leaving the main party room. Suddenly, Duke collapses and dies after drinking from Miles' glass; the panicking group suspects Andi. After the group discovers that Duke's pistol is missing, the power goes out and everyone splits up in the chaos. Blanc finds Andi, but an unseen assailant shoots her. Blanc gathers the rest of the group and announces that he has solved Andi's murder.An extended flashback shows that Andi actually died, supposedly by suicide, a week before the trip, and her twin sister Helen hired Blanc to investigate her death. At Alpha, Andi had halted development of Klear due to safety concerns, and so Miles had her removed as CEO; this maneuver was supported by their friends perjuring themselves by testifying that he had single-handedly sketched out the plan for Alpha years ago on a napkin. However, Andi rediscovered the original napkin where she had written out the idea, and emailed a photo of the evidence to the group. Helen suspects that someone in the group killed Andi to avoid being discredited and to gain favor with Miles. With the news of Andi's death not yet public, Blanc proposed that Helen pose as Andi at Miles' party, helping him investigate.Helen helps Blanc discover motives for each member of the group to protect Miles from Andi: Lionel and Claire have already staked their reputations on Klear, Miles is financially rescuing Birdie from the fallout of employing child labor, and Duke is using Whiskey to seduce Miles in exchange for a role at Alpha News. Helen also discovers that all four other guests visited Andi's home on the day of her death. Helen disrupts the party so she can search the guest rooms for Andi's napkin. When she is shot, Andi's journal in her jacket pocket stops the bullet, but Blanc tells the other guests she was killed, creating an opportunity for her to finish the search in Miles' office.Blanc reveals his deduction that Miles was responsible for both murders. Miles killed Andi after learning she had the napkin, but Duke saw Miles' car leaving her house. When news of Andi's death was finally released online during the party, Duke realized that Miles was responsible and attempted to blackmail him in order to get on Alpha News.

143,tt18079362,"A group of friends made it their life-long mission to go to the Super Bowl and meet NFL superstar Tom Brady. The movie is inspired by the true story of 4 best friends and New England Patriots fans who take a life-changing trip to Super Bowl LI to see their hero Tom Brady play, and the chaos that ensues as they navigate the wilds of the biggest sporting event in the country. As the New England Patriots reach Superbowl LI in Houston four female fans become determined to attend the game and meet quarterback Tom Brady, which proves a more memorable experience than they expected after the Patriots fall behind by four touchdownsÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—fanstp. The film starts in 2017. Four elderly best friends - Lou (Lily Tomlin), Trish (Jane Fonda), Maura (Rita Moreno), and Betty (Sally Field) - are gathered to watch a football game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots, the latter being the ladies favorite team. They prepare for a superstition that they think helps the Pats win, involving Betty stepping on a ladder, Trish reading a magazine in the kitchen, Maura sipping tea, and Lou knocking over a bowl of chips. It works and the Pats win, moving on to the Super Bowl. The ladies cheer for their team and for star quarterback Tom Brady.Trish is known for writing an erotica novel about Rob Gronkowski, as well as being a mascot in ads from her younger days. Betty is great with math and numbers, and she is married to scatterbrained Mark (Bob Balaban). Maura moved into a retirement home after the death of her husband, even though he left their house to her. Lou has been in remission from cancer for 16 years. When the ladies learn from their favorite Pats radio show that there is a contest to attend Super Bowl LI, they decide to enter the contest. Maura gets help from her retirement home friend Mickey (Glynn Turman) to make calls (it is implied he is attracted to Maura), while Lou tries to give a heartfelt story about how she and her friends got into watching football when Brady was a rookie, and it got her through her chemo.Lou announces to her friends that they won the contest and are going to the Super Bowl. The ladies make their preparations, with Betty hiding the truth about her trip to Mark. When they try to pick up Maura, she is fast asleep. Trish distracts the manager Tony (Jimmy O Yang) while Lou and Betty sneak up to Maura's room with help from Mickey and break her out.The ladies arrive in Houston, TX for the big event and stay in their hotel, where they are forced to share two beds. Lou gets a call from her daughter Sara (Sarah Gilbert), who notes that doctors have been trying to reach Lou, but she hasn't answered. She also doesn't tell Sara where she really is.The next day, the ladies head out for the NFL Experience. Lou and Maura get into a football-throwing competition with an employee, and Lou shows she\'s got an arm on her as she wins several bets with other viewers. Trish does an impromptu reading of her Gronk erotica to a crowd of her fans. She meets retired football player Dan O'Callaghan (Harry Hamlin), who takes an interest in Trish. Betty goes to get food and enters a hot wings contest hosted by Guy Fieri. Betty manages to win the contest despite enduring increasingly spicy sauces. Guy invites the ladies to eat barbecue and later invites them to a big party.That night, the ladies attend the party and get in with Dan's help. A young woman that Betty met outside gives her, Lou, and Maura gummies that they did not know had weed in them. Betty realizes that she left the Super Bowl tickets in her fanny pack (which she innocently calls her ""strap-on"") at the wings contest. Lou tries to find Guy, while Maura stumbles upon a poker game and enters, proving she has an incredible hand when it comes to cards. Lou finds Trish and Dan hooking up before joining Betty on the dance floor. When Sara calls again, Lou tells her the truth of her whereabouts. Betty accidentally hits a younger man in the face and comforts him. Trish and Lou find Maura winning in an attempt to buy new tickets, but she learns that the winnings go to charities. Lou gets frustrated outside as the ladies try to comfort her.The following morning, the ladies try to return to the NFL Experience to find Betty's fanny pack, but it's closed. They split up to try and find help. Trish comes across Nat and Pat (Alex Moffat and Rob Corddry), the hosts of the radio show they listen to, and she learns that the actual winners of the contest were a group of four guys called the Tom Brady Support Group since each of them are actually named Tom Brady and feel pressure of living up to QB Brady's name. Maura attempts to get them off a scalper, but he is asking for way too much. Betty ends up running into Guy, and he returns her the fanny pack.When the ladies try to get into the stadium, the head security guard, Chip (Ron Funches), tells them that the tickets they got were fake and that they have been scammed. Lou comes clean to her friends that she bought them online because she fears that this may be the last chance she will have to do something unforgettable, revealing to them that she is afraid to open a letter from the doctors since it could mean her cancer has come back. Lou's friends stick by her side and try to find an alternate way in.The ladies spot Gugu (Billy Porter), a friend that Maura made during the poker game. He agrees to help them get in by posing as his dancers. The four join Gugu and his actual dancers in a little presentation, which impresses the security guard enough to let them pass. The friends get excited as they take their seats. Dan keeps texting Trish, but she tells Betty that she is going to ghost him since she doesn't want to rush into another relationship like with her last husband that cheated on her. Chip spots the ladies when they are featured on the jumbotron, but as he is escorting them out, Dan invites them up to his hospitality box. Trish explains herself to Dan about not wanting to jump so fast into a relationship, but he agrees to take things slow with her.The game starts off poorly with the Pats getting beat by the Atlanta Falcons. The ladies make their way into the coaches booth and work the controls so that Lou can contact Brady through his helmet. She gives him a little speech about how he inspired her when she was going through chemo, and it is enough to encourage Brady to lead the Pats to make a comeback. The Pats play harder and end the game as champions.Maura tells the ladies that she made a bet with a rich jerk who bet against the Pats, and she won some good money. She also speaks to Mickey, telling him to let the staff at the retirement home know she is going to leave and move back into her own house, and she invites Mickey to visit her. Chip finds the ladies and appears to be kicking them out, but he guides them to the locker room to meet the Pats themselves. Betty praises Danny Amendola for his catch record, Maura admires Julian Edelman's beard, Trish gets to meet Gronk, who happens to be a fan of her book, and Lou meets Brady, who thanks her for inspiring him. He also admires her ""80 For Brady"" jersey and asks if he can swap his jersey for hers, which Lou agrees to.In a jump to the year 2020. Sara joins Betty, Trish, and Maura for the next Super Bowl game. It appears as though Lou has died when Trish begins to toast her, but she emerges alive and healthy. The ladies then gather for another epic game.Before the credits roll, the four friends are sitting by the beach with Brady as Maura asks him if he has considered retirement. Brady responds that it's hard to think about retirement ""when you've still got it"", which the four agree too. Finally, there is a text that states the film was inspired by a true story, featuring a picture of the actual four best friends.",comedy,"[[[45 34 30]

144,tt10733228,"Alisha (Deepika Padukone), a yoga instructor, believes that her personal and professional lives are in shambles. She's having trouble finding an investor for her fitness software, and her six-year relationship with Karan, a struggling writer, has reached a stalemate. Just when she thinks she's had enough of her boring life, her filthy rich cousin (Ananya Panday) and her hot-shot fiancee Zain show up (Siddhant Chaturvedi). Within a short period of time, Alisha and Zain become oddly attracted to each other and embark on a passionate love affair, keeping their respective partners in the dark. During their romantic encounters and passionate love-making sessions, the two bond over their traumatic past, blissfully unaware of the impending storm. An early moment in Gehraiyaan, which lasts only a few seconds, embodies the film's entire core. Alisha (Deepika Padukone), the film's protagonist, is viewing an old home movie. It's a scenario from a family vacation, and she recognizes something: her pre-teen self trying to put on a sweater, which gets trapped around her neck and covers her head. Alisha can't see or breathe, and she says she's ""suffocating"" to her mother. That sense of being trapped and suffocated, which dates back to her youth, has followed her throughout her life. Her mother used to describe the same sensation; when the anguish grew overwhelming, she hung herself from the ceiling fan (further suffocated herself). Alisha, like many other children of unhappy parents, fears that she, too, would become like them, that she, too, will be unable to escape their past. It's even more difficult for her because she is constantly reminded of her history. She had known Karan (Dhairya Karwa) and Tia while growing up in Mumbai for a few years (Ananya Pandey). For the past six years, Karan, a former ad writer currently working on a book (noob move), has been dating and living with Alisha. He is oblivious and inattentive because he is engrossed in his own world. Alisha, a yoga instructor, has been having trouble raising money for her mobile app. She avoids her father since she holds him responsible for her mother's death. She feels ""suffocated"" since the sweater has adhered to her again. However, she rekindles her friendship with Tia, and the childhood trio takes a break. There's a new member this time: her fiancee, Zain (Siddhant Chaturvedi). After some time, Alisha realizes that Zain, who has his own scars from the past, isn't all that different from her. He, like Alisha, was unable to save his mother. He isn't from a well-adjusted family, unlike Tia and Karan, and he isn't 'normal.' Zain is a warm blazing bulb in a sea of flickering and chilly tube lights: someone who has been there, someone who understands. They converse, drink, and tell stories. They flirt, joke, and hook up. The sweater is finally loosening up. Alisha can finally take a breath. This wonderful mix of awareness and perplexity makes perfect sense, because it highlights the film's most striking layer: Alisha is living a lie because she is intent on finding and moulding her story. The climax was surprising because we saw Zain, who Alisha had come to see as her anchor, change into someone who wanted to kill her because she had become an obstacle in his life. When Alisha discovers Zain's texts and notices him slipping tablets to her drink, she understands he's been lying to her yet again. In the ensuing brawl, Zain takes a knock to the head and falls off the yacht, killing himself. That's when Alisha returns to the mainland on her own. ""Gehraiyaan"" gets it right when it comes to how trauma may be passed down through generations and how, without correct guidance, we end up repeating the mistakes we are trying to avoid. Alisha began the affair to get out of a dead-end relationship in which she was trapped because she didn't want to be like her mother. However, when the truth was revealed, she realized she had made the same errors. She decides to accept her past and move on from it rather than resisting it in a very vulnerable chat with her father. This reminds us of something we've heard before: you can't get rid of your luggage; you can only learn to carry it in such a way that it doesn't seem as heavy over time. Another part of the conclusion is if Zain was aware of Alisha and Tia's reality and if this knowledge influenced any of his actions. We can only assume that even if he was aware, he did nothing about it because the entire property was obviously in Tia's name. The real kicker, though, comes in the final few seconds of the film. As Alisha makes the decision to put the past behind her, a phantom of it appears in front of her. The old woman who confronted Alisha in the end was someone Alisha and Zain had aided during one of their rendezvous on the yacht while they were still together. At the engagement party, Alisha runs into the old woman, who recognizes her and addresses her by her name. ""Gehraiyaan"" comes to an end here, and it's up to the audience to figure out what transpired. Is Alisha manage to redirect the topic and resolve it in time, or does the old woman explain to Tia how she knows Alisha and Zain? Is everything Alisha tries to put behind her about to resurface and cling to her even more tightly than before? Is it a hint that you'll never completely be able to let go of your past-messy relics will always find their way back into your life? That's the one part where we welcome the viewer's imagination being used.",romance,"[[[255 255 255]

In revenge, PAL takes over Mark's company and orders all the robots to capture humans worldwide and launch them into space. The Mitchells manage to avoid capture at a roadstop cafe in Kansas. Rick decides that his family should stay put in the cafe for their own safety, but Katie convinces him to help save the world instead. They meet two defective robots that tried to capture them, Eric and Deborahbot 5000, who tell the family they can use a kill code to shut down PAL and all the robots.After a hot pursuit with the robots en route, the Mitchells make it to a nearby mall to upload the kill code, but PAL orders all the PAL chip-enabled appliances to stop them. Katie tries to upload the kill code, but is stopped when a giant Furby pursues the family. They ultimately trap and defeat the Furby, destroying a PAL router in the process, which disables the hostile devices but stops the kill code from uploading. Rick then encourages his daughter with the confidence to go to Silicon Valley to destroy PAL with the kill code. On the way there, Linda reveals to Katie that she and Rick had originally lived in a cabin in the mountains years ago as it was his lifelong dream before he gave up on it.Upon arriving in Silicon Valley, the Mitchells disguise themselves as robots and head to PAL Labs HQ to shut it down. However, as they go up to the lair, PAL manipulates them by revealing surveillance footage from the cafe of Katie telling Aaron in secret that she was pretending to have faith in Rick so that he would take them to upload the kill code. As Rick became heartbroken and betrayed when seeing this, the Mitchells fail to reach PAL's lair and Rick and Linda are captured by PAL's stronger and smarter robots, dubbed PAL MAX Prime. PAL then reprograms Eric and Deborahbot into obeying her, while Katie, Aaron and Monchi escape the headquarters.Katie, Aaron and Monchi hide from the robots soon after, as Aaron felt despondent and sadly disappointed by Katie's words. Soon, Katie discovers Rick's recordings of her childhood that she unknowingly recorded over on her camera, realizing that Rick gave up on his lifelong dream in order to give his daughter a better life. In the meantime, Rick watches one of Katie's videos which mirrors his relationship with her daughter. Reinvigorated and in hopes of making up to her family, Katie infiltrates PAL Labs HQ again with the help of Aaron, using Monchi to cause the robots to malfunction, as his appearance causes an error in their programming. With help from Mark, Rick and Linda free themselves and plan to upload a home movie of Katie's with Monchi in it to short-circuit the robots. However, Rick is outnumbered by the robots when he is about to upload the video.Katie and Aaron are eventually captured. Facing PAL to justify saving humanity, Katie explains that no matter how hard her family struggles, they will always stay connected despite how different they are. PAL ignores this reasoning and drops Katie from her lair. Eric and Deborahbot, having been inspired by Rick's ""reprogramming"" himself, that allowed him to use a computer, revert to their malfunctioning states and upload Katie's home movie, saving her and helping the rest of the Mitchells. The family bands together to fight the rest of the improved robots, with Linda leading the charge and destroying dozens. Katie eventually finds and destroys PAL by dropping her into a glass of water, freeing all the humans and disabling all the robots except for Eric and Deborahbot.A few months after the uprising, Katie and her family arrive at her college as she and Rick share one last heartfelt goodbye before she officially goes to college. She later joins them on another road trip with Eric and Deborahbot to Washington, D.C. to accept the Congressional Medal of Honor.",comedy,"[[[114 195 255]

Hilary (Olivia Colman) is a cinema manager struggling with her mental health, and Stephen (Micheal Ward) is a new employee longing to escape the provincial town where he faces daily adversity. Together they find a sense of belonging and experience the healing power of music, cinema, and community. Margate, England, 1980. As widespread unemployment and a rising wave of extremism plunge the seaside town and Margaret Thatcher's Britain into recession, depressed Hilary sticks to her daily routine as the dutiful front-of-house manager at the Empire: a dying, golden-era movie palace. But even movies like All That Jazz (1979) and The Blues Brothers (1980) can't help lonely Hillary keep her inner demons at bay. And then, bright-eyed new employee Stephen suddenly enters the picture, shaking Hilary's troubled existence. If the celluloid-scented power of cinema can pave the way for meaningful human connection, is there still hope for the once majestic movie theatre?Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas",romance,"[[[254 254 254]

After all, nobody wants to be a villain. But evil is cunning, indefatigable, eternal. In the early th century, Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula met English lawyer R. M. Renfield, who was hoping to broker a deal for some land but ended up becoming Dracula's familiar.For decades, Renfield has relied on supernatural powers that are initiated by eating bugs. Dracula has recently had a close call with some vampire hunters who almost killed him, so the duo move to New Orleans to recuperate.

Ambar, an undocumented, desperate Mexican immigrant, moves into a rundown Cleveland boardinghouse after her mother's death. Soon odd things start happening to her, both at the new boardinghouse and outside. Then the unsettling cries and eerie visions begin. Ambar begins to dream about her mother on her deathbed. After years of caring for a terminally ill mother who recently died, Ambar Cruz finally pursues a new life as an undocumented immigrant in Ohio. Ambar rents a room in a boarding house run by Red and his mysterious brother Becker. Ambar soon begins having visions of women haunting the house as well as nightmares involving an unseen creature inside an ancient stone box. Over time, Ambar also briefly meets other immigrant women boarding in the home including Freja, Petra, and Maria.While Red is distracted, Ambar investigates the secret study that is off limits to boarders. Ambar finds artifacts, tapes, and files collected in Mexico by Red and Becker's parents, Professor Arthur Welles and his wife Mary. The materials document Mesoamerican rituals that involve human sacrifices and the stone box from Ambar's nightmares.Ambar's coworker Kinsi scams Ambar out of her cash by promising a fake id only to then disappear. Ambar also loses her underthetable factory job by unintentionally angering her boss.Back at the house, Ambar hears screaming from the shower drain before seeing a brief vision of Freja. Ambar asks about Freja, but Red claims she moved out several days earlier.Paranormal activity that includes pleas for help from invisible entities suddenly plagues Ambar's room. Frightened, Ambar calls unfamiliar family friend Beto, who refuses Ambar's request to provide a place to stay.

When he arrives however, Red claims he doesn't have the cash with him. Under the pretense of returning her money, Red convinces Ambar to return to the house.Back in her room, Red tells Ambar that his father was a crazy person who collected strange items and killed Red's mother.",horror,"[[[255 253 255]

Siblings Mimi and Luke unwittingly resurrect an ancient alien overlord. Using a magical amulet, they force the monster to obey their childish whims, and accidentally attract a rogues' gallery of intergalactic assassins to small-town suburbia. After unwittingly resurrecting The Archduke of Nightmares, an ancient, murderous creature from the Planet Gigax, brother and sister, Luke and Mimi, have a crisis on their hands. On the one hand, the only thing that stands between the alien overlord and global annihilation is a strange pulsating gem of destruction, and on the other hand, the demon's arch-enemies called The Templars, have already dispatched Pandora, a mighty, sword-wielding defender, to stop him at all costs.

When he falls in love with a young, openly gay soldier, his world gets turned upside down. Based on real events. Sergeant Major Eismayer, the toughest training officer in the Austrian Armed Forces, has a secret he carefully hides from public view: he is homosexual. When he falls in love with a recruit, his artificial heteronormative existence is shaken to the core. To a man like Eismayer, a gay relationship cannot be reconciled with the traditional understanding of what a soldier should be. Will he preserve his image of a tough-as-nails man's man or follow his heart? Is there some way to do both? Based on real events.Ã‚Â—Golden Girls Film. Tough, tougher, Eismayer! Among recruits to the Austrian Armed Forces, Sergeant Major Eismayer (Gerhard Liebmann) is known as the strictest and most unforgiving of the training officers. Any soldier who refuses to display total obedience or the high level of discipline Eismayer expects is bound to suffer. Eismayer is a soldier through and through and demands complete and utter commitment from the men he trains - to exhaustion and beyond. Those who fail are subject to merciless tirades, and Eismayer's iron toughness has made him a living legend. In order to preserve his reputation, Eismayer carefully hides an aspect of himself from public view: he is homosexual. His sexual encounters with men take place in secret, unknown to his wife (Julia Koschitz), his son and his comrades. One day he is assigned a new recruit, Mario Falak (Luka Dimic). Mario is openly gay and challenges Eismayer's authority at every possible opportunity. The initially strained relationship between the two men soon develops into a deep love which gives Eismayer the confidence to come out to his wife. She moves out of the shared apartment, taking their son with her. Mario moves in. When Eismayer is diagnosed with lung cancer, Mario not only takes care of him; he also subjects Eismayer to a strict training regime of the kind the sergeant major once forced on others. The training pays off and Eismayer recovers from his illness and returns to work at the barracks. However, he is relieved of his duties as a training officer as a result of his weakened physical state. He continues to keep his relationship with Mario a secret from his comrades, but Mario is tired of the deception and proposes to Eismayer, hoping to enter into a civil partnership with the man he loves. Eismayer\nturns him down, terrified by the idea that he may lose his reputation, but Mario refuses to take no for an answer.",romance,"[[[255 255 255]

A young boy is orphaned when his father is murdered. Years later, the boy has grown into a talented and deadly martial arts fighter, driven by a desire to avenge his father.

Tarla is a slice-of-life film on India's most iconic home chef, Tarla Dalal, who wrote bestselling cookbooks, had her own cookery show and was the only Indian to have received the Padma Shri Award for her work in the field of cooking. Her story also captures the silent women empowerment movement that took place in the 70-80s and shows us how Tarla played an instrumental role in helping women of the era realize their dreams through food. Her journey seems like every Indian woman's story yet remains equally relevant for youngsters today. During her lifetime, Tarla received many letters from women across the country crediting her recipes for getting them approval to pursue their passions. These letters became a major source of inspiration for the film about Tarla's revolutionary journey from her kitchen to the living rooms of the entire country, inspiring homemakers to become entrepreneurs.",comedy,"[[[255 255 255]

Nat Love eats dinner with his parents when Rufus Buck and his gang comes to their house, guns down Nat's parents and carves a cross into Nat's forehead. Some years later, a grown Love, now an outlaw, kills one of Buck's former gang members. Meanwhile, his partners, sharpshooter Bill Pickett and quick-draw Jim Beckwourth, ambush another gang and steal their haul from a recent bank robbery. The lone survivor tells them that the $25,000 they have stolen belongs to Buck. Love travels to meet his former lover Mary Fields who runs a chain of saloons. Pickett brings news of the heist to Love. Buck\'s gang, led by Trudy Smith and quick-draw Cherokee Bill ambush a train on which Buck is being transported by a group of corrupt soldiers. The soldiers reluctantly release Buck, who orders all of them killed save for the youngest. Buck and his gang return to their home of Redwood, where Trudy has a saloon. The town is now run by Buck's former associate Wiley Escoe. Although left in charge by Buck, Esco has used the position for profit at the expense of the town. Buck beats him and orders him to leave town. Buck gathers the townspeople and tells them they will need $50,000 to save the town and proposes a tax to raise that money. He kills a man who objects, but accepts that the townsfolk cannot raise the full amount he needs. In Field's saloon, Marshal Bass Reeves arrives to arrest Love and removes him in handcuffs. The arrest was staged by Reeves and Love in order to hunt down Buck without involving Love's gang: Reeves is angry because Buck has been pardoned, and he knows Love wants revenge. Love's gang, however, accompanied by Fields and her friend Cuffee, suspecting a ruse, follow Love and Reeves and insist on joining.",action,"[[[ 72  95 136]

204,tt1321510,"The film opens on a beach, as Usnavi (Ramos) tells a group of children the story of Washington Heights. He tells them about the concept of a sueÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â±ito, a little dream that everyone has. He begins the story in the middle of the summer in Washington Heights, introducing the main characters of the film: Abuela Claudia (Merediz), the aged matriarch of the neighborhood who took him in and raised him, Kevin Rosario (Smits), who runs the taxi company, the salon ladies Daniela (Rubin-Vega), Carla (Beatriz) and Cuca (Polanco), his younger cousin Sonny (Diaz), who he employs, Benny (Hawkins), who is employed by Kevin at the taxi company, and Vanessa (Barrera), who works at the salon and is Usnavi's love interest, as they each pass by his neighborhood bodega for their morning coffee before they carry on with their day (""In The Heights"").

Alejandro, who runs the local law firm, stops by the bodega to inform Usnavi that his father's old business in the Dominican Republic has been put back up for sale and can be purchased, something Usnavi has always dreamed of buying and reviving; his sueÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â±ito. Meanwhile, Nina Rosario (Grace), Kevin's daughter, returns to the neighborhood from her first year at Stanford University. After a quick reunion with Benny (""Benny's Dispatch""), Usnavi, Sonny and Abuela, she goes to find her father, while dreading telling him of her plans to drop out, due to a combination of loneliness and financial troubles, in doing so letting her neighborhood down (""Breathe""). She meets her father and tells him that she would be unable to pay tuition fees in time, but he brushes her off, telling her not to worry.

Elsewhere in the neighborhood, Daniela, Carla, Vanessa and Cuca work at the neighborhood salon, which will be moving soon to the Bronx due to rising rent. Nina arrives at the salon for a treatment, and they happily oblige, all the while gossiping about her and Vanessa's love interests (""No Me Diga""). The attention soon turns to her studies however, and she is forced to reveal that she has dropped out of university, and leaves. Vanessa, on her lunch break, goes to submit a rental application to pursue her sueÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â±ito of moving downtown to become a fashion designer (""It Won't Be Long Now""). However, she is unable to provide a good credit check and her application is rejected. Disappointed, she heads back to the neighborhood and drops by Usnavi's bodega, where Sonny manages to ask her out on the weekend, on Usnavi's behalf.

Due to the summer heat, the entire neighborhood closes up shop early to head to the local pool. Just as Usnavi, Sonny, and Benny prepare to leave, Sonny receives a call that one of the lottery tickets the bodega has sold has won $96,000. They and the rest of the neighborhood begin to fantasize about achieving their own sueÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â±itos with the money if they were the ones who won (""96,000""). Meanwhile, Mr. Piraguero (Miranda) laments how Mister Softee (Jackson) is stealing his business (""Piragua"").

That weekend, Benny and Nina meet at the park to hang out, as they reminisce about their childhoods spent in the neighborhood. She expresses her doubts and her fears about her self-worth to Benny, but he reassures her that she is destined for greatness (""When You're Home""). Afterwards, Benny walks in on a meeting between Kevin and the dry-cleaner next door, who has tried to buy over the lot where Kevin's business is. Meanwhile, Usnavi goes to talk to Sonny's father about letting him go with him to the Dominican Republic, but Sonny's father informs him that he and Sonny are undocumented immigrants.

That evening, Usnavi, Sonny, Abuela, and the salon ladies gather at Kevin and Nina's house for a dinner party. Later on, Benny arrives and questions Kevin about his earlier meeting with the dry cleaner, forcing Kevin to reveal his news: he called Stanford, and has sold the business to pay for Nina's tuition. Outraged that he went behind her back, Nina refuses the money and storms out, followed by Benny, as Kevin tells the rest of the guests to leave. Usnavi and Vanessa head to the club for their date, along with Benny and Nina. At the club, Usnavi is overly nervous and aloof, and Vanessa dances with other men to make him jealous. Usnavi finds his own partner and tries to make her jealous in turn (""The Club""). Suddenly, the power goes out in the neighborhood, and in the ensuing chaos, Vanessa and Usnavi get separated. Sonny and Graffiti Pete light up fireworks to illuminate the neighborhood, while Benny and Kevin return to the taxi company to direct cars and taxis. Vanessa and Usnavi find each other and argue about their date; Vanessa angrily rejects him and they both go home (""Blackout"").

Nina and the salon ladies go to Usnavi's apartment, where they play bingo and revel in the fireworks. Abuela, lying in bed, reminisces about her childhood in Cuba, living in poverty, and how she and her mother came to New York, enduring hardships to be where she is today, as she passes away, her heart unable to take the summer heat (""Paciencia Y Fe""). Usnavi discovers her unresponsive and calls the emergency hotline, but it is too late. The entire neighborhood comes together to mourn her passing and sing her praises (""Alabanza"").

At a neighborhood protest for DACA, Nina learns that Sonny cannot go to college as he is an undocumented immigrant. She resolves to go back to university to find a way for undocumented children like Sonny to find a pathway in life. She informs Kevin of her decision, and he happily tells her that she has surpassed him, and encourages her to pursue her goals, telling her to disregard anything negative people say about her.

While clearing out the trash, Usnavi discovers Vanessa's rental application that she had thrown away. He visits Daniela as she is packing up and preparing to move her business, asking her to co-sign on Vanessa's application. Afterwards, disappointed with the block's negative attitudes over the blackout and Abuela's passing, Daniela rouses them into a celebration of their shared Latin culture, as the entire neighborhood joins in (""Carnaval Del Barrio""). Vanessa and Sonny express reservations, but Usnavi convinces them to let go of their worries and celebrate in the moment, as the blackout finally ends.

A month later, Nina finishes packing to return to Stanford, and she and Benny agree to pursue a long-distance relationship. Benny reaffirms his faith in her, and promises to make his way over to California to be with her, as they finally kiss (""When The Sun Goes Down""). At the same time, as Usnavi finishes preparing to leave for the Dominican Republic the next day, he discovers that Abuela held the winning lottery ticket, and has passed it on to him. Just at that moment, Vanessa shows up and flirts with him, having found out that Usnavi convinced Daniela to co-sign on her lease, and bought him a bottle of champagne to thank him. She quietly suggests that Usnavi should stay, but he refuses. Distraught, she finally kisses him, and laments that she was too late in realizing her feelings for him (""Champagne"").

Afterwards, Usnavi visits Alejandro and Sonny, giving him the winning ticket and telling him to use it for Sonny's legal fees as he applies for documentation. The next morning, Usnavi walks around the neighborhood one last time, and runs into Vanessa. She takes him to his old bodega and shows him a new fashion line she created the previous night, having been inspired by Graffiti Pete's paint rags. Graffiti Pete has painted a mural across the wall of the beach where Usnavi's father's old business used to be, and another one celebrating Abuela Claudia and her famous motto, ""Paciencia y fe"" (Patience and Faith). Usnavi has an epiphany and tasks Sonny and Pete with telling the neighborhood of his decision to stay. The story returns to the present day, where the beach where Usnavi is telling his story is revealed to be the new shop that he and Vanessa built together, he is revealed to have married Vanessa, and one of the children is revealed to be Usnavi's daughter.

The film ends with present-day Usnavi, Vanessa and their daughter dancing with the rest of the neighborhood, and past Usnavi accepting the neighborhood as his true home (""Finale"").

In a post-credits scene, Piraguero is celebrating the overflow of customers now that the Mister Softee truck broke down, and gives the Mister Softee driver a piragua. (Piragua [Reprise])",romance,"[[[ 65 103 148]

206,tt2560092,"An orphaned boy is told by a fortune teller that an elephant will help him find his lost sister. follows Peter, who is searching for his long-lost sister. When he crosses paths with a fortune teller in the market square, he want to know, is his sister still alive? To get the answer, he must find a mysterious elephant and the magician who will conjure it, setting Peter off on a journey to complete three seemingly impossible tasks that will change the face of his town. The town of Baltese had lost its hope in magic and warmth after the war, which is why nobody had any time to waste fantasizing about wild and exotic animals; there were only domesticated animals reared for produce. The very first mention of the elephant is when Peter, a young orphan raised by a soldier toughened by his time at the war-front, Vilna Lutz (Mandy Patinkin), approaches a fortune teller out of curiosity. Vilna had sent Peter on an errand to buy old bread and a small fish as he trained Peter for another inevitable war so as to increase his chances of survival. Vilna saved Peter (Noah Jupe) from the war-front after his whole family had been wiped out. He brought him up in harsh conditions so that Peter wouldn't lose his life and stay alive in even the worst conditions caused by war.Vilna's only guilt had been that he could not save Peter's sister, Adele (Pixie Davies), and thus he had lied to him about her dying at birth. He could not bring himself to tell Peter that it was his decision to take him away and entrust Adele to Sister Marie. But, a bomb later wiped out the house housing Sister Marie and Adele, which is why Vilna thought they had died then. Therefore, Peter lived with this as the truth and never sought out Adele. Vilna argued that if Peter had hope, he would never grow up to be a good soldier. He tells the story of a young recruit, who used to find comfort in fairy tales. Vilna took away his story book and the recruit grew up to become the most feared soldier in the King's army.As he arrived at the town square to buy his daily dinner, Peter, intrigued by the Fortune Teller's (Natasia Demetriou) tent as well as how well she seemed to know him, decided to spend his only coin designated for food on a question that changed his life. The Fortune Teller mentioned that his sister Adele was alive and that if he wanted to find her, he would have to follow the elephant.The story of following an elephant seemed just that-a story. However, impossibility gave way to likelihood when the opening act of a terrible magician at the opera summoned an elephant out of thin air, using a magic spell. Albeit, it was a fluke, as the magician (Benedict Wong) simply desired to bring back the lost hope, warmth, and magic of Baltese. Both the elephant and the magician were locked up as the weight of the elephant had crushed the legs of a noblewoman attending the show. However, the arrival of the elephant brought joy and hope to two individuals: one was Peter, who sought his sister, and the other was surprisingly his sister Adele, who had dreamed of an elephant leading her to her brother earlier that day.Adele had been safely raised by her nurse, Sister Marie (Dawn French ), who had traveled to the army camp on the words of Vilna only to find it destroyed due to another bomb. Sister Marie had taken Adele away from the city to take care of her on the outskirts, away from any harm. Sister Marie also had the same guilt as Vilna, where she was constantly reminded of how she had let Peter go and that she should have saved them both. She loved Adele and thus gave in to her wishes when she asked to visit the elephant, as Adele saw her as a sign of hope.Peter decided to save the locked-up elephant in order to find his little sister, and his downstairs neighbor, Leo Matiennel (Brian Tyree Henry), decided to help him. Leo is an official of the King's court and a captain of the Palace Guards. Leo then notified the King (Aasif Mandvi) of the arrival of an elephant in the town of Baltese to intrigue him into visiting the town when he saw that the Countess (Kirby Howell-Baptiste) was not bending to his request for the elephant to be released. The countess was swayed by the court who thought the elephant to be an instrument of a foreign power and wants to kill the elephant.The arrival of the King signified a shift in power. Leo invites Peter to the court at the unveiling of the Elephant. Peter saves the day by washing the elephant's eye when it was getting agitated due to chalk residue falling into its eye. Peter says that the Elephant is detained to lead him to his lost sister and asks for custody of the Elephant. Due to his love for dramatics and flair, the King decided on three impossible tasks for Peter to complete so as to own the elephant. His first task was to defeat Romain De Smedt, who was a one-man killing machine. Peter recognizes him as the same person from whom Vilna stole the book of fairy tales. He ran across the town, evading Romain and got the book. Peter won him over by returning Romain's lost book that had been stolen by Vilna so as to push him to become the soldier he was so he would survive.The second task had been for Peter to fly, and this is where the efforts of Leo and his wife Gloria (Sian Clifford) came through. They designed a parachute for him, and Peter used it to glide through the air, successfully mimicking the art of flight, which he used to win over the King as well. Declared the winner of yet another round, Peter was set up for another impossible task, which was to make the Countess, who had been known for her stoicism after she lost her brother to war, laugh. He had been rather unsuccessful with his joke, although the Countess tried a fake laugh to help him out. The King just wanted her to enjoy the moment and thus decided that would not fly by. However, the plot armor decided that it wanted Peter to win and thus made the elephant sneeze all over the King. Seeing the most powerful man in the kingdom covered in snot, the Countess burst out laughing, which genuinely made the King smile as well. He declared Peter the winner.Peter, after two of those tasks, had already changed his mind about using the elephant to find Adele; rather, he had come around to helping the elephant find its own family. Peter regularly took care of the elephant and thus had a bond with her. So, when the King announced that Peter had lost the privilege to own the elephant, Peter was very upset, as he now simply wanted the elephant to return to her natural habitat, as she surely did not belong in the city. This is why the plot armor had taken matters into its own hands and thought fit to let Peter win after all. The elephant symbolized the lost trust, light, and hope that the town of Baltese had. The Countess finally laughed for the first time since she had lost her brother and locked her emotions down, which meant the return of her emotions. The magician had been terrible at his own art due to the fact that the people of the town chose not to believe in their own emotions as well as in hope and magic. Also, the complaining attitude and the judgmental look of the noblewoman, a mighty Karen right there, had made matters worse for now, as the town had locked up the magician, who had failed his final trick to return the warmth that once was in the town of Baltese. The magician, now equipped with the belief and trust of the townsfolk, was now able to channel the spirit of magic and was able to send the elephant back to her natural habitat.Meanwhile, Adele had unknowingly met her brother Peter, who had been troubled with the task of making the Countess laugh. Their interaction had been brief but spoke of familiarity. They met again when Adele came around to ask Peter why he had let the elephant go, as he was meant to follow her to find his destiny. With the disappearance of the elephant came light and hope that cleared out the dark, gloomy clouds, lifting the curse of the town and letting the light shine through. Meanwhile, Vilna found the courage to finally get out of his house and walk around with his cane instead of the wheelchair. As he reached the town, clearly proud and impressed, he came across Sister Marie, whom he had thought had lost her life along with baby Adele. Sister Marie couldn't believe her eyes when she realized that Peter and Vilna had been alive all this time. Thus, sparking a reunion, it marked the town's overcoming a long war where they had forgotten how to feel and thus ridding Baltese of its gloomy clouds for good. The story ends on a warm note, with the sounds of joy and laughter echoing through every street of the town as Peter enjoys a meal with his newfound family.",comedy,"[[[255 255 255]

A group of animals who have superpowers team up to rescue the Justice League as they are trying their best to defeat an evil guinea pig who wants to reunite with her partner and destroy everyone and everything in order to conquer the world. During the destruction of the planet Krypton, a Kryptonian Labrador Retriever Krypto (Dwayne Johnson) comforts fellow infant survivor Kal-El as they head in an escape pod toward Earth.Years later, now known as the famous superheroes, Krypto and Superman (John Krasinski), they live in the city of Metropolis under their dual identities, Bark and Clark Kent. Clark is a reporter and journalist at the Daily Planet, a newspaper company, and dating Lois Lane (Olivia Wilde), a fellow journalist of whom Krypto is jealous. Whenever Superman is with Lois he tries to keep getting rid of Krypto, which makes him insecure.\nThinking that Krypto needs a friend to distract him, Clark heads to an animal shelter to find one. A Boxer named Ace tries to escape the shelter (he wanted to go to a place called the farm for his freedom), but Krypto stops him. Ace reveals to Krypto that Superman is inside the shelter trying to find a new companion for Krypto. This saddens him.\nLater, Superman and Krypto spot their archenemy, LexCorp CEO Lex Luthor (Marc Maron), reeling in a meteor strapped with orange kryptonite with a tractor beam, intending to gain superpowers (The Orange kryptonite gives powers, instead of taking them like the green one). He is easily defeated as the two are aided by the Justice League (AQuaman (Jemaine Clement) (an Atlantean demigod, superhero, and the king of Atlantis), Cyborg (Daveed Diggs) (a former football player and superhero who gained cybernetics after an accident), Wonder Woman (Jameela Jamil) (an Amazon princess and super-heroine from Themyscira), Green Lantern (Dascha Polanco) (a super-heroine and member of the Green Lantern Corps), The Flash (John Early) (a police forensic scientist and superhero who protects Central City with his immense super-speed) & Batman (Keanu Reeves) (A vigilante superhero who protects Gotham City)).",action,"[[[247 247 255]

209,tt12788488,"A disgraced internet personality attempts to win back his followers by livestreaming one night alone in a haunted house. But when he accidentally pisses off a vengeful spirit, his big comeback event becomes a realtime fight for his life. The film centers on Shawn, a disgraced YouTube personality known for videos featuring him performing stunts to ""overcome his fears."" Prior to the start of the film, one of Shawn's videos resulted in a serious controversy that lost him his sponsors and much of his fanbase. Desperate to regain his popularity and retain his new sole sponsor, Shawn plans to livestream himself spending the night in Death Manor, a purportedly haunted house where several people have died.As part of the deal with the sponsor, if Shawn leaves or doesn't fully explore the house, he forfeits the sponsorship. Throughout the stream Shawn periodically opens the chat screen to react to his viewers' comments. As the livestream begins, Shawn throws his car's sparkplugs into the woods, then locks the door behind him and throws the key down a grate. While setting up his cameras, he narrates Death Manor's history It is haunted by the ghost of Mildred Pratt, a wealthy Mormon heiress and failed poet, who died by suicide after her publisher and paramour's sudden death. Subsequent occupants of the house died mysteriously and the place was eventually abandoned. Shawn speculates that the various deaths over the years were Mildred trying to build a family she was unable to have in life. Shawn tours the house and introduces each room, including one with no history of paranormal activity. He declares it the safe room and sets up his equipment there. He discovers a strange symbol hanging in a closet, removes it and later destroys it in a panic.Afterwards, Shawn attempts to provoke the spirits via a sance. After experiencing some strange noises, he fearfully shuts himself up in his room. It turns out to be Chrissy, a super fan who has traveled to Death Manor to meet him. Shawn, reluctant to share his spotlight, begrudgingly allows her stay to please his viewers. They investigate more of the house, finding Mildred's poetry book, which Shawn dismisses as mediocre as it ""doesn't even rhyme"". As the two attempt to speak to the spirit of Mildred through a spirit board, Chrissy convinces Shawn to recite a Latin phase to put the ghosts to rest.",horror,"[[[10  0  1]

210,tt9072352,"A daughter, mother and grandmother are haunted by a manifestation of dementia that consumes their family's home. When elderly mother Edna inexplicably vanishes, her daughter Kay and granddaughter Sam rush to their family's decaying country home, finding clues of her increasing dementia scattered around the house in her absence. After Edna returns just as mysteriously as she disappeared, Kay's concern that her mother seems unwilling or unable to say where she's been clashes with Sam's unabashed enthusiasm to have her grandma back. As Edna's behavior turns increasingly volatile, both begin to sense that an insidious presence in the house might be taking control of her. With RELIC, firsttime writerdirector Natalie Erika James crafts an unforgettable new spin on the hauntedhouse movie. When Edna, the demented, elderly, and widowed matriarch of the family, goes missing, her daughter Kay and granddaughter Sam travel to their remote family home to find her. They discover the house locked from the inside, and a strange black mouldlike substance on an upstairs wall. Much of the furniture has been adorned with Postit notes of reminders for Edna.That night, Sam is visited by their young neighbour Jamie, who states that he had not been to visit Edna for a while after his father had told him not to go back to the house. Sam and Kay grow increasingly disturbed by a loud creaking from inside the walls and the appearance of more black mould throughout the house; Kay experiences nightmares of a withered rotting corpse in an old shack in the woodlands.The next morning, Kay finds Edna has returned, barefoot and muddied, but unaware of her own disappearance. Following a visit from a doctor, Edna is found to be mostly of sound mind, and physically stable, with the exception of a large black bruise on her chest resembling the mould. Kay tells Sam that she plans to move Edna into a retirement home, given her selfneglect, much to the contempt of Sam. Later that night, Kay awakes to find Edna sleepwalking toward the front door, whispering, ""It's nothing"".",horror,"[[[ 2 28 29]

In Rome, a serial killer has strangled three prostitutes with cello rope. The Cellist's last rope is destined for Diana, a luxury escort who frequents the hotels of Via Veneto. One night, the maniac chases driving a van and rams her, sending her crashing into another car. She awakens in the hospital, shrouded in darkness. The diagnosis is final: she lost her sight in the crash. Rita, a young woman from the Blind Society, helps Diana with her first steps in the darkness and in her new life; in the meantime, the police investigate, unsuccessfully. But it won't stop there. The Cellist must finish his work. Diana, helped by Chinese orphan Chin, can only try to escape. The cat and mouse game has just begun. In an almost deserted, summery Rome in the midst of a hypnotic solar eclipse, a mysterious serial killer starts targeting high-end prostitutes. Diana is one of them. In a desperate attempt to escape him, she becomes the victim of a serious car accident that leaves her blind. After a long period of rehabilitation, Diana learns that the only other survivor of the crash is a now-orphaned child of Chinese descent named Chin, and she decides to take care of him. Coming from different cultural backgrounds, the two connect via a special bond that allows them to defend themselves from the serial killer's thirst for revenge. Dario Argento returns to directing after a ten-year hiatus with a film that mixes the mood of Italian ""giallo"" pulp fiction in his early work with his legendary touch of horror, albeit this time with a dose of sharp irony thrown into the mix. Occhiali neri is a headlong dash between city and countryside that explores the social conflict between rich neighbourhoods and Rome's so-called Chinatown. The maestro's gaze transforms this nightmare into pure geometry, and the class war into the kind of metaphysical architecture reminiscent of Antonioni.",horror,"[[[254 253 248]

To cope with these memories, Frank begins secretly drinking; he asks Beth not to tell Wally as Frank is a recovering alcoholic.Beth and Frank arrive home to attend the funeral.

240,tt13024674,"A prequel, set before the events of Army of the Dead, which focuses on German safecracker Ludwig Dieter leading a group of aspiring thieves on a top secret heist during the early stages of the zombie apocalypse. ""Six years before the apocalyptic events of Army of the Dead (2021), timid small-town bank teller Sebastian leads a solitary, uneventful existence against the backdrop of an unheard-of virus outbreak in Las Vegas. Fascinated by locks and safes, the enthusiastic YouTuber and theoretical safe-cracker will get the chance to shine when mysterious Gwendoline enlists his help to pull off the heist of the century: crack a quartet of impenetrable, Richard Wagner-inspired safes. However, as Sebastian and Gwendoline's band of thieves embark on a frenzied mission across Europe, obsessive Interpol agent Delacroix is hot on their trail, and things are starting to look bleak in Sin City. Now, in the face of impossible odds, one man is about to write history. Is insecure Sebastian destined to become a legend? After charming audiences as the wisecracking hero Dieter in Zack Snyder's zombie blockbuster Army of the Dead, Matthias SchweighÃ¶fer takes centerstage in the film's prequel, which he also directs. Ditching the undead, Army of Thieves puts a modern spin on classic heist films with European flair and an unlikely love story. Produced by Snyder and co-starring Nathalie Emmanuel (the Fast and the Furious franchise), Army of Thieves chronicles the harrowing adventures that transformed Dieter from a sheepish German bank teller named Sebastian into the badass safe-cracker who became a fan-favorite character in Army of the Dead.Sebastian's impassioned YouTube videos about the fabled safes designed by the locksmith Hans Wagner (Christian Steyer) catch the eye of Gwendoline (Nathalie Emmanuel), a beguiling career criminal whose take-no-prisoners exterior belies a desire to love and be loved. To Dieter's shock, Gwen enlists him to be part of her motley crew of some of Interpol's most wanted: the jack-of-all-trades Korina (Ruby O. Fee), rugged bad boy Brad (Stuart Martin), and getaway sidekick Rolph (Guz Khan). As the five misfits zigzag across Europe cracking a trio of impenetrable vaults known as the Ring Cycle - Das Rheingold, the Valkyrie, and the Siegfried - French law-enforcement officials Delacroix (Jonathan Cohen) and Beatrix (NoÃ©mie Nakai) are hot on their trail. Anchored by a simmering romance between Dieter and Gwen, Army of Thieves broadens the scope of Snyder's Army Universe while staying true to its vision as its own movie.",action,"[[[244 102  26]

Babloo's father funded a politician's campaign and made him MP. in return they got the liquor license and Lipakshi. When opportunity arrives in the form of their driver's (Mishra (Abhay Joshi)) son Raj Kumar (Armaan Ralhan), she tries to make the most of it. Raj, a brilliant graduate in finance, gives up a job opportunity in London to work for Babloo for what initially seems like more money. Raj had a confirmed offer for Rs 15 Lakhs in London, but Babloo convinces him to work for Babloo for Rs 25 Lakhs. He makes profits for Babloo and also subtly hits on Lipakshi without Babloo's knowledge. Although Babloo has no love for Lipakshi, he doesn't spare her lovers for the sake of his family's reputation. Lipakshi keeps making moves at Raj, who finally gives in one night when Babloo is away. That marks the beginning of a steamy, romantic affair between Raj and Lipakshi. They even make plans to elope together one night after lovemaking.

The very same night, Babloo receives pictures of Lipakshi with Gopal (Arvind Pandey), his trusted aide (who manages the entire cash flow from his liquor business). He calls for Raj, who is about to leave, and reveals that he has fallen in love with him (Babloo is gay basically) and would want to be with him forever. He shows the pictures to Raj and orders him to kill Lipakshi. Raj, a little taken aback, tells him to handle Gopal while he goes for Lipakshi. Raj gets on a bus, and we see Lipakshi leaving with her bags. While beating up Gopal, Babloo sees a video of Raj kissing Lipakshi and is stunned.

In the same video, Raj reveals that Gopal is innocent, and it was him who was Lipakshi's lover all along. He reveals that ever since Babloo broke his father's leg for crashing a car into a planter, all Raj wanted was revenge. So he stole a lump sum of 10 Crores from Babloo while he worked for him and left the country along with his parents. After the reveal, Lipakshi is waiting at the railway station for Raj, who never arrives. Instead, Babloo finds her. She reveals she's pregnant, and they both hold hands, crying and bonding over their love for and betrayal by the same person.

Khilauna The story opens with Meenal (Nushrat Bharucha) losing electricity at her home after the linesman remove her illegal connection to the power lines.

Meenal is a street-smart housemaid who lives in the slums along with her little sister Binny (Inayat Verma). She struggles to make ends meet and send her little sister to school. She works in a rich locality for a lady who is struggling to conceive. It is shown that Meenal holds contempt for the rich people she works for. When told about her electricity problem, her employer mentions that she could seek help from Vinod Agarwal (Maneesh Verma), the new secretary of the locality. In the same locality is Sushil (Abhishek Banerjee), who owns a small laundry stall. While in the locality, Sushil is seen cussing Meenal and his sister, but behind everyone's back, they are lovers (Meenal and Sushil). The story keeps flipping back and forth between the present, where Meenal is shown to be at a police station with a policewoman inquiring her about the 'incident' and her telling that she had nothing to do with it.

It is shown that Vinod Agarwal has a pregnant wife and has the hots for Meenal. He finds her at Sushil's stall and asks her to work at his place to help his wife. Meenal happily agrees, hoping to get in a word with him regarding electricity at her place. Meenal leaves her previous employer for Vinod Agarwal, and she is shown to have a good bond with the pregnant wife. The baby is born. When the wife is away, Vinod makes a move at Meenal, asking her to have sex with him if she needs electricity back. Binny witnesses this. Meenal leaves crying and goes to Sushil's stall. He is concerned and asks her about what happened. Later, Vinod Agarwal also arrives at Sushil's stall and starts hitting him for flirting with women and being insolent. Passers-by stop this fight, and the secretary apologizes for his misconduct. Electricity is restored to Meenal's home.

Vinod then invites Meenal, Sushil, and Binny to a party he and his wife are hosting to celebrate the birth of their son. We switch to the present, and we see the Police Inspector Jairam Srivastav (Sreedhar Dubey) bringing Sushil to the station and beating him up. Meenal is warned that if she doesn't reveal what she did, it would be Binny's screams she'd be hearing next. Sushil begs the police to stop hitting him and tells him that he didn't do anything except breaking the transformer and that Vinod Agarwal made a move on Meenal.

Meenal takes the name of her previous employer Abha, saying she did it as she was jealous that she was infertile. We're taken back to the party where we see Meenal, Binny, Abha (the ex-employer) taking turns with the baby. Sushil arrives and is shown to be very angry. He steals some alcohol and heads out of the party, drunk, and breaks the transformer, leading to a power cut in the party. Vinod Agarwal and his wife get some flashlights and realize their baby is missing. They look for him, and Vinod goes to the kitchen to see the pressure cooker releasing blood instead of water. Abha arrives at the police station and says something to the police. The police then search Binny's bag and find the baby's toy in there. When asked if she took it from the baby, Binny replies that she did so because the baby was just a toy. Implying the Binny put the baby into the cooker.

Geeli Pucchi Bharti Mandal (Konkona Sen Sharma) is a worker at a factory. She is well educated and qualified and is looking to get a higher-paying data operator job in the same factory. Her dreams are shattered with the arrival of Priya Sharma (Aditi Rao Hydari), who is given the position not because she has the right technical skills for the job but because she has the right connections. Bharti is bitter and is told by a co-worker that she didn't get the job because of her caste.

Priya arrives at the canteen for lunch and tries to strike a conversation with Bharti, who doesn't reciprocate. Bharti gets into an altercation with a male co-worker and is hurt. Priya tends to her wounds and tells her that she reminds her of her childhood friend Kavita. When asked her full name, Bharti lies that she's Bharti Banerjee. Bharti is a lesbian. It is shown that Priya is in a loveless marriage herself and has lesbian tendencies. The two ladies go out together the next day when Priya reveals to Bharti that she doesn't know any of the technical skills required for the job but was only employed because of her palm-reading skills. This greatly hurts Bharti, and she cries while Priya hugs her. Slowly, they start developing a bond. Priya reveals to Bharti that her childhood friend Kavita doesn't talk to her anymore and is married and doesn't want anything to do with her because she's happy.

One day, Priya visits Bharti, and they have a moment. Priya is visibly upset and apologizes. Later on, Priya invites Bharti to her birthday party, where she lives with her husband and in-laws. Priya gets very emotional during the party, and when Bharti and Priya are alone, she reveals that she feels no love for her husband even though he's accommodating and nice. She also tells her that her husband Shiv Sharma (Sreedhar Dubey) wants a baby, and she doesn't feel right about it. Bharti tells her that it's not a defect and the only easy way out is to accept the truth. She then reveals to Priya that she's Bharti Mandal and that her family belongs to the lower Dalit caste whose women are traditionally in the midwifery business. This causes a change in Priya's attitude and she becomes distant..

Priya is then thrown a surprise birthday party in the office with her company's higher officials. Bharti is not allowed and is only called in to serve cake to everyone. Bharti cries, and when Priya comes to her, she tells her that the best way to deal with her internal conflict is to have a baby and become a mother just like Kavita. She then goes on to help Priya conceive while she handles Priya's work. A now pregnant Priya goes on maternity leave, recommending Bharti to take over her responsibilities. After the birth, Bharti visits Priya. Priya's husband mentions that she'd return to work soon, but Priya's mother-in-law is completely against it. She asks Bharti for her opinion since she comes from a family of midwives (thereby revealing that Priya told her family about Bharti's Dalit status). Bharti then takes her revenge and recommends against Priya returning to work (when she knew fully well that Priya wanted to return to work and her objection would torpedo the entire plan). Bharti goes to work and is told by her boss (Gyan Prakash) that Priya has quit and Bharti can now take over the job completely.

Ankahi Natasha (Shefali Shah) and Rohan (Tota Roy Chowdhury) are parents to Samaira (Sara Arjun), who is on the verge of going deaf. While Natasha is a loving and supportive mother, Rohan is a distant father, immersed in work and reluctant to learn sign language to communicate with his daughter. After an altercation with Rohan, Natasha visits a photo gallery where she meets Kabir (Manav Kaul), a deaf photographer. They bond and start hanging out often. One day, Natasha visits Kabir's house, and they both have a moment. Natasha breaks out, realizing it's wrong, and walks out to find a message from Rohan saying he's immersed in work and would be leaving Samaira at his mother's. This causes Natasha to go back to Kabir, and they make love.

The next morning, Kabir wants to reveal his love for her but is too afraid. Natasha dresses up and leaves for her house. Kabir follows behind, mustering the courage to reveal his feelings for her. Natasha reaches home and is happy to see that Rohan is talking to Samaira, and they're both bonding, making jokes, and laughing. She's happy at this change and turns around to close the door only to see Kabir in tears (Kabir realizes that Natasha has a family and there is no future for them). She doesn't know what to do and closes the door, apologizing and crying. Samaira, who has witnessed all of this, asks her mother if Kabir loved her.",romance,"[[[155 148 122]

Ron's malfunctions set against the backdrop of the social media age launch them on a journey to learn about true friendship. Twentieth Century Studios and Locksmith Animation's ""Ron's Gone Wrong"" is the story of Barney, a socially awkward middle-schooler and Ron, his new walking, talking, digitally-connected device, which is supposed to be his 'Best Friend out of the Box.' Ron's hilarious malfunctions set against the backdrop of the social media age, launch them into an action-packed journey in which boy and robot come to terms with the wonderful messiness of true friendship.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Twentieth Century Studios. Tech giant Bubble creates an algorithm to help children find friends and develop relationships through the use of robots called B-bots. A combination of a smartphone and a best friend, B-bots seem to take the world by storm. Soon everyone seems to have a B-bot... except for Barney, a middle-school student who lives with his father and grandmother in a small house on the edge of town. Barney's family is very poor, so he is not well-liked and tries not to be noticed at school. When students begin to bully Barney for not having a B-bot, his father and grandmother set out to get him one. They are not allowed into the store, but they discover a man in a loading bay who sells them a damaged B-bot. Barney and the B-bot, Ron, have a difficult start to their relationship. Ron embarrasses Barney in front of a popular girl who used to be his friend. But then Ron puts the bullies in their place, and Barney becomes best friends with him. When a bully discovers why Ron acts so unusually, he removes the security settings on his own B-bot and commences a chain-reaction that wreaks havoc throughout the entire school. Bubble's CEO Marc Wydell wants to meet Ron and learn more about him, but Marc's manager, Andrew, believes a defective unit could spell bad news for their company. Andrew will do anything he can to destroy Ron, while Barney will do whatever it takes to keep him safe. Barney helps Marc discover what's missing from Ron's algorithm, and they set off to stop Andrew and undo the damage the B-bots have done. Tech giant Bubble unveils their latest creation: the B-bot, created by Bubbles CEO Marc Wydell with the intent to make a robot buddy that is designed to help make friends, via algorithm. In the city of Nonsuch, California, middle-schooler Barney Pudowski is the only kid in his class who doesn't have a B-bot. His former childhood friends, Savannah Meades, Rich Belcher, Noah and Ava have all become absorbed by their individual B-bots. On Barney's 12th birthday, his father, Graham, and his grandmother, Donka, come to realize that he doesn't have any friends. They hastily go to a Bubble store, but closes for the day, leading them to buy a slightly-damaged one from the store's delivery driver.Barney receives the B-bot as his late-birthday gift, but upon activating it, he quickly learns that it's defective and glitchy. Not wanting to upset his father, Barney decides to take it back to the Bubble store to get it fixed, but ends up running into Rich and his friends who taunt and try to humiliate Barney. The B-bot begins to fight back as his safety functions have been disabled, with him and Barney happily running off. However, Rich called the police and they along with Graham and Donka are taken to the Bubble store so that the B-bot can be crushed. Not wanting to see him go, Barney secretly rescues him and names him Ron, a shortened version of his model number.When Barney and Ron's actions are reported, Marc is happy to see Ron go against his programming while his COO Andrew Morris views it as bad publicity, believing Ron must be destroyed for the issue to be resolved. Barney teaches Ron how to be a good friend and, while hanging out, runs into Savannah who tells Ron that he needs to help Barney get friends. Despite Barney telling Savannah not to, she posts Ron's actions online, alerting Bubble. The next day, Ron gets out of the house and tries to get ""friends"" for Barney, bringing a series of random people to school. As Barney gets in trouble, Rich discovers Ron's unlocked function and downloads it, causing all the other B-bots to have their safety features turned off. The B-bots run wild and, in the end, after the B-Bots have a patch update, Savannah is publicly humiliated.Barney is kicked out from school and tells Ron off, but upon returning home, realizes that Ron was truly being a friend and decides to run away with him when Bubble employees come for him. They briefly run into Savannah, still upset over her incident, and tells her that he is hiding in the woods. Meanwhile, while Andrew warns Marc about the ramifications of the B-bot, Marc sneaks away so that he can meet Ron while Bubble uses their resources to take control of all the B-bots to go looking for Ron and Barney in the woods. Due to the cold weather and Barney's asthma, he becomes weak and Ron brings him back to civilization just outside the school where Savannah, Rich, Noah and Ava rush out to help him.Barney is taken to the hospital and recuperates before meeting Marc who patched Ron, making him like every other B-Bot. Barney demands that Marc access the cloud to get Ron's original personality, but Andrew took over the Bubble company and locked Marc out. Through an elaborate plan for Barney, Graham, Donka and Marc breaking into Bubble HQ, Barney manages to make it to the Bubble database, finds Ron's original data by his light and uploads him back into his body, restoring him back to his original code. Seeing that Bubble has direct access to everyone's B-bot and realizing that everyone is just as lonely as he was, Barney suggests upgrading all the B-bots to have Ron's flaws. However, this means that Ron will be dispersed. Barney reluctantly says goodbye to Ron as his programming is spread to everyone, mixing Marc's friendship algorithm with Ron's code. Marc blackmails Andrew into giving his position of CEO back after secretly recording him admitting that the B-bots spy on their owners for profit.Three months later, everyone has a faulty B-bot, but are happy with their wild and weird personalities. Barney no longer has one, but has become much more sociable and has gotten close with his former friends. As they hang out at recess, a giant Bubble tower that overlooks Nonsuch produces Ron's face.",comedy,"[[[ 0 10 28]

246,tt1016150,"A young German soldier's terrifying experiences and distress on the western front during World War I. The story follows teenagers Paul BÃ¤umer and his friends Albert and MÃ¼ller, who voluntarily enlist in the German army, riding a wave of patriotic fervor that quickly dissipates once they face the brutal realities of life on the front. Paul's preconceptions about the enemy and the rights and wrongs of the conflict soon crumble. However, amid the countdown to armistice, Paul must carry on fighting until the end, with no purpose other than to satisfy the top brass' desire to end the war on a German offensive. At the start of World War I, Paul Baumer (Thomas) is a young German patriot, eager to fight. Indoctrinated with propaganda at school, he and his friends eagerly sign up for the army soon after graduation. But when the horrors of war soon become too much to bear, and as his friends die or become gravely wounded, Paul questions the sanity of fighting over a few hundreds yards of war-torn countryside. With dreams of serving the Fatherland and Kaiser Wilhelm II, idealistic 17-year-old Paul BÃ¤umer and his chest-thumping schoolmates enlist en masse in the Imperial German Army three years after the outbreak of World War I. And with a mind aflame with patriotic fervour instilled by their jingoistic teacher's rousing speeches, the unripe defenders fantasise about performing heroic feats as they march into battle-scarred Northern France. Instead, the chaos of trench warfare and the horrors of war await the inexperienced brothers-in-arms, who now risk life and limb for the glory of Germany. As the irrefutable certainty of death crushes the companions' romantic visions, Paul must fight tooth and nail to stay alive until the Armistice of 11 November 1918 takes effect and the guns on the Western Front fall silent. After all, war is a game for politicians and generals; for the common soldier, it is a waltz of death on the battlefield. In Spring 1917, three years into the First World War, 17-year-old Paul BÃ¤umer enlists in the Imperial German Army alongside his school friends, Albert Kropp, Franz MÃ¼ller, and Ludwig Behm. They listen to a patriotic speech by a school official and unknowingly receive uniforms from soldiers killed in a previous battle. After they are deployed in Northern France near La Malmaison, they are befriended by Stanislaus ""Kat"" Katczinsky, an older soldier. Their romantic view of the war is shattered by the realities of trench warfare on the Western Front, and Ludwig is killed by artillery on the first night.",action,"[[[ 98 117 134]

Upon arriving in Miradero, the pair meet local young riders Pru Granger Marsai Martin who is a rodeo rider and her father Al Andre Braugher, and Abigail Stone Mckenna Grace and her brother Snips Lucian Perez, who has a donkey named Carrots. Abigail has a horse named Boomerang.nFortuna is awkward with Jim, since she cant figure out why Jim abandoned her after the death of Milgaro. Fortuna finds her mother's old room in Jim's house.The next day, Lucky goes to a corral where she sees the same horse from before trying to be abusively manhandled by a man named Hendricks Walton Goggins. Hendricks is an outlaw and had seen the mustang with his herd from the train he was on the same train as Fortuna.nLucky tells Jim and Cora about the horse, thinking he can be her new friend, but Jim does not want Lucky going near the horses after what happened to Milagro. Nonetheless, Pru and Abigail help Lucky win over the trust of the horse Lucky entices the mustang with apples, whom she names Spirit. After a while, Spirit trusts Lucky enough to eat an apple she offers him, and allows her to pet him, sealing their bond.Lucky attempts to ride Spirit but he escapes from the corral and runs away, while Lucky is saved by Pru and Abigail after almost falling off a cliff. Jim finds and scolds Lucky for disobeying him. They go home arguing, making Lucky think he has given up on her. She sneaks out at night through the forest where she finds Spirit and his herd together, but are interrupted by Hendricks and his men, who capture all the horses but Spirit who resists fiercely and is left alone by Hendricks and take them in with a stolen train. Knowing Hendricks and his men are wranglers, who are taking the horses to a boat to be auctioned and worked to death, Lucky agrees to help Spirit rescue his herd. She enlists Pru and Abigail with their horses to embark on a journey to try and cut the wranglers off on their path by beating them to a water depot located beyond a summit called Heck Mountain which is near impossible to cross on horseback, but allows them to shortcut the train to the docks, where Hendricks will load the horses on a boat. During the trip, Lucky builds up her relationship with Spirit, and becomes good friends with Pru and Abigail as they travel.nTheir plan is to reach a water depot, where the train has to stop to refill its water, before Hendricks gets there and ambush the train.The girls reach the water depot the night before the wranglers are set to arrive, but Lucky wakes up the next day realizing the wranglers made it earlier than expected. Spirit desperately attempts to save his herd on his own, but gets taken in by the wranglers. Determined to save Spirit, Lucky and her friends follow the train to the docks, where the wranglers are boarding the horses onto the boat. The girls arrive too late to stop the boat from leaving, but they manage to save Spirit. Lucky and Spirit get on board the boat by leaping off the docks, and free the other horses and subdue the wranglers, with Spirit knocking Hendricks off the boat. Jim, Cora, and Al who were notified of the girls absence by Snips show up on a fast steam train JIm had been building the fastest train in his shed and brought it out to chase down Hendricks, and arrest Hendricks and the other wranglers. All the horses and Lucky jump off the boat and reach the shore.On their way back to Miradero, the girls travel to a field in the middle of the wilderness, and Lucky lets Spirit go, saying that he needs to stay with his herd. When she returns home, Lucky and Cora initially plan to return to the city, but after Lucky bonds with Jim at a rodeo, she decides instead to stay in Miradero with him and her friends, as Spirit is seen riding through the fields with his herd.",comedy,"[[[127  41  40]

His family gathers to mourn, and soon a darkness grows, marked by waking nightmares and a growing sense that something evil is taking over the family. The Dark and The Wicked follows two siblings who are summoned back to the family farm to await the inevitability of their father's death.

Their mother seems disturbed and expresses a desire for the children to leave. At night, she hangs herself in the barn after cutting off her own fingers in the kitchen.As time goes on, Louise and Michael start to understand what happened to their mother.

Later that night, Father Thorne appears at the farm, beckoning them from outside, before vanishing before their eyes.

Picking up shortly after the previous film, Rose leads the human spaceship fleet against the alien spaceship fleet. The aliens, called 'Harvesters', are on board the mother ship, called Armada, in orbit of the Moon. However, after breaking through the enemy lines, Rose freezes before she can fire and one of her ships is destroyed. With the Armada preparing to fire on Earth, Rose is forced to destroy one of her own ships when it gets into the crossfire, sacrificing thousands of her own men, but she succeeds in destroying the Armada. Wracked with guilt, Rose vanishes following the battle while humanity rebuilds over the next five years, living alongside billions of freed alienhuman hybrids called 'Pilots'.Five years after the battle, Rose lives in a tent city near the ruins of London, avoiding resistance forces led by Leon searching for her and keeping the aging effects of her hybrid nature at bay with the help of hyperoxygenated blood transfusions prepared for Rose by her friend Dr. Mal. A viral pandemic strikes the Pilots and anyone using transplanted Pilot limbs such as Huana who lost both of his arms and a leg while fighting against the aliens fifteen years before. The virus eats the Pilots alive while reverting them back into their brainwashed state. Leon captures Rose and brings her before General Radford who reveals that the Armada's core drive warped to the Harvester home world, named Cobalt One, moments before Rose destroyed the ship. Only with the Armada's core drive do they have a chance of saving the Pilots. After being reunited with her Pilot adoptive brother Trent, Rose reluctantly agrees to join the mission.At Cobalt One, the team's ship crashes after a collision with an empty Harvester vessel that leaves the ship running on emergency power. The crew of Rose, Trent, Leon, Owens and Alexi find the planet filled with the bodies of dead Harvesters and strange shadow creatures that appear to be mutations of the Harvesters. Alexi is heavily wounded and sacrifices herself with a pulse grenade to kill the creatures, but the team manages to reach the Armada where Rose is briefly possessed by the Matriarch, the Harvester leader who accuses the humans of coming to destroy her species.",action,"[[[45 55 90]

261,tt8589698,"The film follows the Turtle brothers as they work to earn the love of New York City while facing down an army of mutants. After years of being sheltered from the human world, the Turtles set out to win the hearts of New Yorkers and be accepted as normal teenagers through heroic acts. But they soon get in over their heads when an army of mutants is unleashed upon them. Fifteen years ago, a Techno Cosmic Research Institute strike force is ordered by executive Cynthia Utrom to capture rogue scientist Baxter Stockman, who stole company secrets and technology, and any research. Desiring a family, Stockman creates a mutagen to create his own mutant family, starting with a housefly maggot. Before he can create more mutagen, the strike force arrives. While it is dealt with by the fly mutant, an explosion in the fight destroys the lab and most of the research while killing Stockman. Additional TCRI forces arrive and collect the remainder of the surviving research, but forget the mutant and the last canister of mutagen, the latter of which falls into the sewers below.In the present, in New York City, four turtles (Michaelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, and Donatello) have been raised by their adoptive father Splinter. While they are adept in the arts of ninjitsu, they are instructed to only leave for the surface world to get supplies for their home in the sewers.During these runs, they occasionally go and see attractions like outdoor movies, concerts, and sports, which makes them want to be on the surface more. When Splinter discovers what they have been doing, he punishes them, explaining their backstory: the mutagen from Stockman's house fell on the four baby turtles, who were found by Splinter (then a rat that was cynical and untrusting of the surface world, specifically of humans). While handling the turtles, Splinter also comes into contact with the mutagen, mutating all of them to have more human-like features. As the Turtles grew older and became more curious about the surface, he decided to take them to the surface where they are all nearly killed. This leads Splinter and the Turtles to all learn martial arts for their protection.Sometime later during one of their supply runs, the Turtles accidentally get the attention of a teenage girl named April. While yelling at the turtles but not seeing them, she gets her moped stolen. The Turtles are able to get it back after defeating the group that stole it and reveal themselves to her. April shows the turtles to her high school where the group discusses their goals: the turtles want to be embraced by the surface world, while April is an aspiring journalist, who wants to move past an embarrassing viral incident where she vomited from anxiety during her school announcements. They decide to help each other out; April has been investigating a series of violent robberies on TCRI technology by a criminal named Superfly, which have led parents to call for a city-wide curfew that would cancel the school's Prom. If she records and writes an article on who Superfly is and how the Turtles would stop him, April and the Turtles would be regarded as heroes and accepted. Meanwhile, TCRI has been following the reports of the Superfly robberies. Cynthia decides to place trackers on any technology to find him.Using leads from April, the Turtles find out that Superfly is collecting a piece of technology that night in a deal under the Brooklyn Bridge. They are able to find the part and pose as the buyers, and discover that not only is Superfly a fly mutant, but also has a gang of mutants with him like Leatherhead, Mondo Gecko, Genghis Frog, Wingnut, Scumbug, Ray Fillet, and Bebop and Rocksteady. Ecstatic that there are other mutants, Superfly invites the Turtles to go on a night in the town with him and his gang, where they bond. He explains his story and plan: like the Turtles, the mutagen evolved him and the rest of his mutant gang, and he took on the role of their father figure. When he brought them to the surface, they too were nearly killed by humans, but they escaped. In their escape, Superfly nearly killed a human. Deciding that humans are all evil and would never accept them, he would create a weapon that would turn the ooze into an airborne virus, which would mutate all non-human wildlife on the planet, and make them the dominant species while enslaving humanity in the process. The Turtles try to stop them by trying to escape with the last part, but Superfly and his gang escape with it, and the Turtles are left to be captured by TCRI, who had a tracker on the part. Having followed the Turtles from a distance, April leaves to get Splinter to rescue them.At TCRI headquarters, the Turtles are slowly ""milked"" of their mutagen, before they are rescued by Splinter and April. Betrayed by his sons' lies and despite stating that April is the only good human, Splinter decides that they will stop Superfly before they stay in the sewers permanently. When they reach the island, Leonardo and Splinter plead to the conscious of Superfly's gang, stating that if they enslave humanity then they are no better than the humans themselves. The gang agrees and everyone fights Superfly, destroying the machine in the process.Unfortunately, the ooze enlarges and combines Superfly with other local wildlife into a bipedal whale-like creature who dubs himself ""SuperDuperFly"", deciding to attack New York City. The Turtles, Splinter, the Mutants, and April head to mainland New York City to stop him once and for all. While the Turtles, Splinter, and the Mutants fight, April is able to overcome her anxiety and explain on live air to the public what is going on, leading the citizens of New York to help stop SuperDuperFly. Donatello discovers that the blowhole on the back of his neck carries a massive amount of mutagen, and the Turtles are able to drop a canister of anti-ooze into SuperDuperFly's blowhole, returning him to being a regular fly.The Turtles, Splinter, April, and the Mutants are recognized as heroes by the city, and the boys reconcile with their father, who apologizes for his xenophobic behavior. Soon after, the Mutants move into the sewers with the Turtles and Splinter, and the Turtles enroll at April's high school, where they are all embraced as heroes.In a mid-credit scene, the Turtles are shown enjoying high school life: Michaelangelo is participating in the school's comedy improv team, Raphael has joined the wrestling team, Donatello has found the computer club, and Leonardo (who, throughout the film, has developed a crush on April) has decided to help her with her journalistic interests, now focused on TCRI who have mysteriously disappeared since the events of the film. While the five are later enjoying themselves at the school prom, Cynthia, who is spying on them (and with the now unmutated Superfly by her side) decides that the focus is to capture the Turtles by bringing in Shredder.",comedy,"[[[ 55  35  34]

In the aftermath of a tragic accident that killed their son, Rachel and Anthony decide to move to the other side of the world and focus on their surviving twin son Elliot. What begins as a time of healing and isolation in the Scandinavian countryside turns into a desperate battle for the very soul of their child, as an entity claiming to be his dead twin brother takes over Elliot  setting Rachel on a diabolical journey to unravel the horrible truth about his twin. Rachel, her husband Anthony, and their son Elliot have moved to Finland from New York in order to deal with the grief of losing Elliot's twin brother Nathan in a car accident. During an excursion Elliot discovers a wall purported to grant wishes and makes a secret wish. Shortly thereafter he begins talking to an invisible person. Rachel attends a welcome party held by the townspeople where she meets the town doctor and Helen, the latter of whom cryptically references Elliot's wish.Elliot begins to exhibit increasingly disturbing behaviors, including him claiming that he is Nathan. An attempt by Rachel to get the town doctor to treat Elliot ends with him insisting that she is sick and needs therapy. Desperate for answers Rachel reaches out to Helen, who tells her that the town is part of a satanic cult. Helen further remarks that her dead husband was possessed by an evil entity that showed up in photographs. At home, Rachel takes photographs of Elliot and brings them to the town to get developed. Later she and Elliot hold a sance of sorts that is interrupted by the townspeople and Anthony, who inform her that they want to use Elliot as part of a ritual.The following day Rachel retrieves the photographs and is terrified when Elliot doesn't show up in any of the pictures. She takes them to Helen, who tells her that this is the demon taunting her. She convinces Rachel to take her to Elliot so she can try to save him, but upon meeting the boy Helen instead tells Rachel that she is sick. The two women are then surrounded by the townspeople. Rachel is sedated and forced to participate in a satanic ritual, after which she is again sedated. When she awakens Rachel is locked in her room, but manages to escape after she hears Elliot call for help.Anthony chases Rachel into the forest, where he reveals that Elliot does not exist. Rachel was trying to leave Anthony and take Nathan with her when the accident occurred. Out of a sense of grief and anger she created Elliot as a coping mechanism. Eager to avoid leaving Rachel in an asylum, he went along with the delusion and moved her to Finland to start over. ""Elliot"" then flees, insisting that Anthony is trying to kill him. Rachel follows him to a grain silo, where Anthony again tries to appeal to his wife by ""killing"" Elliot by submerging him in the grain. This instead results in Rachel accidentally killing Anthony in an attempt to stop him. She then tries digging Elliot out of the grain, only to find nothing.The film ends with Rachel returning to New York, where it is shown that she is still delusional. Despite visiting Nathan and Anthony's graves, she believes that they, along with Elliot, are still alive.",horror,"[[[ 8 25 43]

The catch: You don't know what will happen until you take it. While some develop bulletproof skin, invisibility, and super strength, others exhibit a deadlier reaction. But when the pill escalates crime within the city to dangerous levels, a local cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) teams with a teenage dealer (Dominique Fishback) and a former soldier fueled by a secret vendetta (Jamie Foxx) to fight power with power and risk taking the pill in order to track down and stop the group responsible for creating it. In near-future New Orleans, a mysterious distributor offers a free supply of ""Power"" - a pill that grants various superpowers for five minutes to a group of drug dealers, including one named Newt.Six weeks later, Newt's teenage cousin Robin, a dealer herself, is nearly robbed by customers seeking Power. She is rescued by NOPD Officer Frank Shaver, one of her regular buyers. Art, a man hunting for the distributor ""Biggie,"" tracks down Newt, who dies after a struggle when he overdoses on Power. Frank foils a bank robbery by a Power-enhanced thief, but is suspended for using Power himself. His captain reveals that government personnel are pressuring him to terminate any investigation into Power, and gives Frank a picture of the man they suspect to be the source of the drug: Art.Using Newt's phone to find and abduct Robin, Art forces her to take him to the drug cartel's safe house. He is shot while eliminating several of the cartel's men, and discovers that Power users throughout New Orleans are being monitored as test subjects for the drug. Art bonds with Robin as they treat his wounds, and reveals that after leaving the military he was recruited by Teleios, a private defense contractor who experimented on him to create superpowers. His daughter Tracy, born after the experiments, exhibited powers without ever taking the drug, and was abducted by Wallace, a Teleios operative.Art and Robin find Biggie hosting a private demonstration of Project Power for a potential buyer near the Superdome, where large groups of Saints fans are arriving for a home game. Biggie claims that Power represents ""the next evolution of the human species,"" with the pill's powers derived from the abilities of animals, such as the chameleon or the wolverine frog.",action,"[[[ 5 12 22]

274,tt9308382,"Maggie Sherwoode is the longtime personal assistant to legendary R&B singer Grace Davis who still has a successful touring career despite not releasing new material for a decade. Maggie is also an aspiring music producer, remixing Grace's songs in her free time. Grace's manager, Jack Robertson, believes that her time has passed and she should accept a Las Vegas residency and continue releasing live albums rather than record new material.

At a grocery store, Maggie meets aspiring musician David Cliff and watches him perform outdoors. He invites her to a party at his place, where to her surprise she learns that despite slumming it as a musician he is quite wealthy. Impressed by his voice, she lies about being a professional producer and offers to work with him on an album. He accepts and the two begin work together with Maggie coaching him through his nerves.

Grace is displeased when a popular music producer remixes one of her songs to modernize it with excessive synths and pop elements. Appalled, Maggie shows Grace her own version of the song, and Grace decides to release Maggie's version, without payment or credit. While Maggie is pleased to be producing for Grace, Jack pulls her aside to reveal how her tactlessness ruined potential future deals. Grace later expresses her interest in recording a new album to her record label. They discourage the idea and push her towards the Vegas residency to Grace's embarrassment. Maggie encourages Grace to disregard the label and create new material but Grace lectures her on how women of her age and race rarely succeed in music.

Maggie and David begin a romance as recording for his demo comes to a close. At the same time, Maggie learns that Ariana Grande has backed out of opening for Grace's album launch. She initially books Dan Deakins to open for Grace before realizing the album launch would be the perfect place for David to perform his songs. She enlists Dan's assistant to help but is surprised when Dan himself, after listening to David's songs, decides to step away to allow him to perform.

The night of the party, Maggie tells Jack and Grace that Dan has backed out and promises to fix it. She then asks David, who believed they were going on a date, to sing. After hearing that the party is for Grace Davis, David leaves in a huff, refusing to perform. Maggie tells Jack and Grace she was unable to deliver a backup performer and Grace berates her, mocking her ambitions to become a producer when she cannot even succeed as an assistant before firing her.

Maggie moves back home with her dad Max, a radio DJ, and starts planning her future. After encouragement from her father, Maggie reaches out to David to continue work on their album and to Grace to thank her for her time working for her. At the same time, Grace realizes that she misses Maggie who was a faithful assistant who never used her.

Grace arrives at Maggie's home and reluctantly offers a roundabout apology. After complimenting her production work on the live album, she reveals that she has never worked with a female producer before but wants Maggie to be the first, also telling her that she has begun writing new material. As she is singing for Maggie, David arrives. Before Maggie can introduce them to one another, David reveals that Grace is his estranged mother, something she has kept from the public. David also tells Maggie that Dan Deakins has been passing around his material leading him to receive an offer of representation from a studio.

Later on, David performs at a music festival. He asks Grace to join him on stage, revealing she is his mother, and the two sing a duet as Maggie watches. Later in the studio, Maggie produces Grace's new album.",romance,"[[[  0   0   0]

281,tt14995258,"As a little girl, Roxana (Camille Rowe) used to go to the beach with her grandfather, who taught her to dive. The peace and tranquility that she experienced underwater were incomparable to worldly pleasures. She studied to be a marine biologist at college. One day, she noticed a poster of the world-famous free-diver, Pascal Gautier (Sofiane Zermani), who would be giving diving lessons to those interested. Without giving it a second thought, Roxana paid the course fee and reached the location on time. She met Tom (CÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©sar Domboy) there, a diving instructor who worked with Pascal. The two shared unmissable chemistry on the first day of class, but the moment Roxana had set her eyes on Pascal, she knew whom she wanted. There are 3 golden rules: 1. Always dive with a partner. 2. Dont try to dive as deep as possible 3. stay calmed and relaxed. Pascal had an incredible pain tolerance capacity, which was why he could endure the pressure and dive deep into the water. His calmness and capability impressed Roxana, and she could not take her eyes off him during the dinner party after the practice session. Pascal was a womanizer. Even with his girlfriend by his side, he continued to flirt with Roxana. They passionately made out in the washroom, and upon returning, his girlfriend broke up with him.

Pascal taught Roxana the techniques to stay under water. Their shared passion for diving brought them closer to each other. Roxana felt at peace in Pascal's presence, and she would not trade it for the world. She soon joined Pascal's team in a practice session. On the first day itself, she understood how risky the profession was. While Pascal was aiming to set a world record by diving 172 meters underwater, his team was spread across several levels (at every 40 ms, with oxygen tanks) to monitor him. The dive is set up with a sled that takes Pascal very deep and whenever he is ready to come back up, he activates an gas cylinder which provides the thrust to quickly shoot him back up to the surface. Only submarines have gone below 172 meters ever. at that depth, the lungs are the size of an orange and a person cannot be given oxygen as their lungs would explode. Even though Pascal managed to complete the dive safely, one of his team members lost his life. Stephane (Laurent Fernandez), a team member, blamed Pascal for sending the rookie 40 meters down.

The team needed a new member, and Roxana stepped in to fill the position. Stephane was against it, knowing how risky it could be for her, but Pascal trusted Roxana's capability. He believed she was a natural and could adapt easily. Roxana learned the safety protocol and was prepared to assist Pascal. On the day of the event, Pascal successfully dived 172 m, and the team celebrated the new world record. Roxana was on top of the world. She had never felt so alive. She informed her mother that she would leave her studies to accompany Pascal on his journey. Her mother was not supportive of her decision, but she refused to listen to her advice. A few days after setting a new world record, another free-diver managed to go 174m down. Pascal had to compete now, and he was aiming for 176m. But this time, luck was not on his side. He suffered from a blackout, and the doctor advised him to stop diving. Pascal was not ready to give up, and Roxana could not change his mind, knowing how passionate he was about his profession. As he took a break, he introduced Roxana to the world of free-diving. She soon set a new record for French women by going 56m deep in the CWF (constant weight with fins) category. She was celebrated by the media for her achievement, and Pascal watched her from a distance.

Pascal could not accept defeat when a US woman Naomi (Natalie Mitson) created another new world record (beating the men's record of 174 m by diving till 178 m). He was determined to dive 180m and create a new record, but his team and the organizers knew that he was not fit enough to do so. As Roxana rose to fame (she consistently continued to shatter more world records and was celebrated as a sex symbol), Pascal could feel his importance fading away. Roxana looked up to him; he was her lover and her mentor, but he could not stand the celebration anymore. He was proud of Roxana but disappointed in himself. He went as far as to state that he would be happy to watch her set the new world record rather than allow any other person to do so. It was important for him to be involved either as a participant or as a coach.

Roxana could sense the growing distance between her and Pascal. He would often leave her at night, and she would be left alone. Roxana's childhood was not easy. Her father committed suicide as a result of depression when she was 12. She always wondered why her father left her, and gradually she became obsessed with the idea of death. She attempted suicide, hoping to join her father, but her grandfather saved her life. We get a sense of how Roxana had been searching for the meaning of her existence, and it was only after meeting Pascal that she realized who she was meant to be. She emphasized how important Pascal was in her life and how the trophies and titles did not hold any value without him in her life. But he did not feel the same way. He was not ready to give up. For him, the competition mattered more than what he shared with Roxana. He decided Roxana would compete in the no-limit category even though his entire team thought it was a bad idea, but Roxana took up the challenge. She ends the argument by saying that she is doing the dive for herself. As she trained to prove Pascal right, he cheated on her.

Pascal attempts the dive at 180 m and blacks out again. Roxana wants to quit, but Pascal wont let her. Roxana soon found out about his affair (when she follows Pascal one night and sees him kissing another girl), and she sought comfort in Tom. She tells TOm that her next dive (the record attempt) will be her last. She and Tom have sex. Roxana wants to leave Pascal, but he smashes his hand into a mirror and guilt her into staying. Roxana continues to train with Pascal. Pascal finds out that ROxana cheated on him with Tom.

On the day of the competition, Roxana is thrown off by the appearance of the girl with whom Pascal cheated on her. Tom finds Pascal tinkering with the ballast tank, after he and Stephane did the final check on all the equipment. The dive starts and at the bottom, the ballast tank fails to open. Roxana is stuck. She runs out of air and her body gradually floats back up, where Stephane fishes her out of the water. Tom knows Pascal killed Roxana, but doesn't say anything to the police. The death is deemed accidental.",romance,"[[[255 255 255]

After passing a physical examination and meeting his park guide Alma, he learns of the local legend of Parnag Fegg, a woodland spirit. The following morning, Martin and Alma begin their twoday hike toward Olivia's site.Alma informs Martin that Olivia has not been heard from in months. The pair come across an abandoned tent, with the remaining items indicating it belonged to a family. The next night, Martin discovers a rash on his arm before he and Alma are assaulted by unknown assailants who also raid their camp, destroy their equipment, steal their shoes, and loot some of their supplies. Without his shoes, Martin badly cuts his foot.They are approached by Zach, a man living in the woods who offers to lend the pair some shoes.

While they are unconscious, Zach takes ritualistic photos of them in strange clothes and positions and stitches a strange symbol and animal gut into Martin's arm.Upon waking up Zach describes the symbol as a mark to be seen by a presence in the woods, claimed by him to have once been an ancient sorcerer who placed his essence in a standing stone somewhere in the forest.

A personal tragedy will involve looking back and analyzing pending issues and secrets. Mara, Nacho and Suso are three lifelong friends. The three have experienced many things together, some very beautiful and others not so much, things that united or separated them. And suddenly, in the middle of life, they must face death. The announced death of one of the three, who is suffering from a terminal illness. Before that happens, there are many matters to close plans, promises, reproaches, laughter, reconciliations, apologies, memories, more laughter, tears, laughter again, pending issues and some other secret that perhaps the time has come to uncover. 'Friends Till Death' is a dramatic comedy. Or perhaps an emotional tragicomedy. Or maybe even a macabre romantic comedy. It is a comedy that laughs at death and a drama that suffers for a love that is reciprocated. Mara, Nacho and Suso will have to ask themselves many questions and they have very little time left to answer them. They probably don't have an easy answer to any of those questions, but what's certain is that the three of them will try to solve them together, because that's what they're 'Friends to death'.",comedy,"[[[255 255 255]

293,tt11125620,"The Addams get tangled up in more wacky adventures and find themselves involved in hilarious run-ins with all sorts of unsuspecting characters. Sequel to the 2019 animated film, 'The Addams Family'. Everyone's favorite spooky family is back in the animated comedy sequel, The Addams Family 2. In this all new movie we find Morticia and Gomez distraught that their children are growing up, skipping family dinners, and totally consumed with ""scream time."" To reclaim their bond they decide to cram Wednesday, Pugsley, Uncle Fester and the crew into their haunted camper and hit the road for one last miserable family vacation. Their adventure across America takes them out of their element and into hilarious run-ins with their iconic cousin, It, as well as many new kooky characters. What could possibly go wrong? At a middle school science fair, Wednesday Addams is set to present her experiment, but is dismayed when her family - Gomez, Morticia, and Pugsley - show up. She proceeds with the presentation, where she uses her pet squid Socrates' DNA on Uncle Fester to show how humans can be improved. The experiment is a success, but when Wednesday goes up to accept what she thinks will be a first place prize, she finds that everyone got a trophy for their efforts. Her work, however, gets noticed by scientist Cyrus Strange, who appears through a holographic projection to let her know he thinks her work is brilliant. Meanwhile, Pugsley attempts to impress girls by tweaking another kid's volcano project, but it ends up causing a huge disaster in the gym that sends everyone running.Back at the Addams home, Wednesday and Pugsley decline to show up for dinner. Fester goes up to Pugsley's room to try and help him find a way to woo the ladies. Wednesday sends her parents a very specific note for why she isn't coming to dinner. Gomez worries that the kids are drifting apart from him and Morticia, so he decides to take them on a family vacation.Gomez brings out a hideous road vehicle and gets Thing, Fester, the kids, and Lurch to join him and Morticia on the road while Grandmama stays behind to take care of the house. Before they hit the road, a lawyer named Mr. Mustela approaches Gomez and Morticia with the implication that Wednesday was switched as a baby at the hospital, meaning she may not really be an Addams, but the two ignore him and think it's just Wednesday trying to get out of going on the trip, but she says that she doesn't know who that man is. Once the family is gone, Grandmama throws a huge party. On the road, Mustela and his hulking henchman Pongo pursue the Addams family.The family is initially set on going to Salem, but Fester ends up making a detour to Niagara Falls because he is suddenly obsessed with water due to him mutating because of Wednesday's experiment with the squid. Pugsley tries to make another attempt with girls per Fester's advice, but his cheesy line backfires. Wednesday gets a voodoo doll of him and uses Pugsley to perform some dance moves, until she just tosses the doll over the Falls to torment her brother. When Gomez and Morticia attempt to bond with Wednesday, she snubs them. They then spot Mustela and Pongo looking for them, and Fester ends up knocking Mustela into the water before recovering Pugsley.The family then stops in Sleepy Hollow where they set up camp. While gathered around the fire, Gomez and Morticia bring up Mustela and his claims about Wednesday, so Fester mentions a story from the night Wednesday was born where he went into the delivery room to see her, but all the other babies were crying, so he employed an Addams family tradition of putting babies to sleep by taking them out of their beds and juggling them all, potentially mixing up many babies in the process. This only worsens Gomez and Morticia's fears that Wednesday was switched. Wednesday overhears the discussion and muses to Lurch about where she might really come from.Gomez brings everyone to Miami in an attempt to get in touch with Cousin Itt so he can help with their current dilemma. Itt joins them on the trip as they pass through San Antonio where he talks to Wednesday about his own rebellious phase in his youth, but he essentially says he owned up to who he really is. When Grandmama calls him to help with the house party since she let it get out of hand, Itt must bail. Mustela and Pongo almost catch up with them, but Lurch knocks them away.To hide from their pursuers, the family goes to a motel where they enter a displeased Wednesday into a girls beauty pageant where she creates a scene. Mustela enters, but is distracted long enough for the family to escape.The Addams' stop at the Grand Canyon where Itt flies off from them, and Morticia gives Wednesday a necklace containing the blood of the Addams family members. Pugsley blows up the canyon, drawing more unwanted attention. Meanwhile, Fester starts to mutate further into a squid-man. Wednesday goes off by herself where Mustela attempts to get her again, but she gets the drop on him and traps him. His phone rings, and she sees that he was employed by Cyrus Strange, who suggests to Wednesday that he is her true father and that he is inviting her to stay with him in Sausalito where she can hone in her potential in science. Wednesday runs a DNA test using Gomez's hair, which seemingly proves that she most certainly is not his daughter.Wednesday leaves the family while they sleep, but Lurch catches up with her to keep her safe. The rest of her family learns where she is headed and go after her. Wednesday and Lurch stop at a biker bar to ask for help in getting to Sausalito, which they do after Lurch shows off his piano and singing skills by performing ""I Will Survive"". The bikers then escort the two to Sausalito.Wednesday arrives at Cyrus's home and meets his wife Ingrid, a bird-like humanoid being, and their pig-like daughter, Ophelia. Cyrus brings her to his lab where he shows her a formula he developed much like Wednesday's own that she used on Fester regarding human-animal hybrids. The rest of the Addams clan shows up, but Wednesday seems fully set on staying with Cyrus and no longer accepting them as her family. While Gomez and Morticia are sad, Pugsley tries to bond with Ophelia since they seem to be mutually attracted. However, Ophelia morphs into a pig, as that is what she originally was. When Pugsley brings this revelation to his parents, Cyrus reveals the truth and that he was just using Wednesday since her formula works better than his own. He then captures the family.Cyrus traps the clan in tubes where he plans to mutate them with his formula. He shows them to Wednesday so that she may remove any traits of theirs that she doesn't like, but she doesn't like seeing them trapped this way. She turns on Cyrus, but when he tries to have Pongo go after her and Lurch, it is then revealed that Lurch and Pongo knew each other and were really good friends at the asylum they were locked up at before Lurch was found by Gomez and Morticia. Pongo warned Lurch with a look that Wednesday was in danger. Together, the two brutes free the Addams family and knock Cyrus into a tube where he is doused with his potion. It turns him into a gigantic animal hybrid monster. When he goes after the family, Fester comes out as a giant squid monster, and the two fight until they both tumble out the window. Cyrus falls to his death while Fester pulls himself up with his tentacle, but he is now weakened. Wednesday uses the blood in the necklace that Morticia gave her, and Fester turns back to normal and is revived. Wednesday decides she is proud to be an Addams and reunites with her family.The family returns home, with Ophelia joining them as a regular human girl, where Itt has helped Grandmama turn the party around. While Wednesday knows Cyrus fabricated the DNA test results, she wonders how her test came out so that she isn't related to Gomez. He reveals his hair is a toupee, but that she is 100% his daughter. The family then goes on another road trip around the world.",comedy,"[[[ 51 102   9]

Jann is an avid gamer from Cardiff who spends his days playing Gran Turismo, refusing to succeed in the real world. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, Danny, a marketing manager for the Nissan automobile corporation, is running an advertising campaign and, together with the management of Gran Turismo, hatches a plan to launch a competition inviting gamers to try their luck in real racing cars. Needing help organizing an event, Danny turns to Jack, a former racing driver and incorrigible cynic. When fate brings Jann together with Danny and Jack, the gamer becomes the driver of a Nissan racing car, plunging headlong into the fight for a place in the sun in the competitive world of real racing. Following a pitch by marketing executive Danny Moore, the motor sport division of Nissan establishes the GT Academy to recruit skilled players of the racing simulator Gran Turismo and turn them into real racing drivers. Danny recruits former driver-turned-mechanic Jack Salter to train the players. Jack is initially hesitant but accepts after tiring of the arrogance of his team's driver, Nicholas Capa. Meanwhile, Jann Mardenborough, a teenage clothing store employee and gamer from Cardiff, Wales, is an avid player of the simulator and wants to become a racing driver, despite the disapproval of his former footballer father Steve Mardenborough.One day, Jann learns he is eligible for a qualification race to join the GT Academy after setting a time record for a particular track. The night before his race, Jann is invited by his brother Coby to a party, and the brothers take their father's car. Jann flirts with a young woman named Audrey whom he develops a crush on. The gathering is disbanded after police arrive, and Jann initiates a pursuit after driving away when their friends are pulled over. The brothers escape but are caught returning by their father. Jann is taken to his father's place of employment the next morning in an attempt to be taught a life lesson, but leaves early to partake in the qualifying race, which he wins, earning a place in GT Academy.At the academy camp, Jack puts the competitors through their paces in various tests, through which ten competitors are narrowed down to five. During one of which, Jann crashes with Jack in the car and claims the brakes were glazed, later proven correct by analysts, to Jack's surprise.",action,"[[[190 177 158]

301,tt7947604,"Following a drunken encounter, two equally attached men from a cash strapped and divided gay rugby club unwittingly sleepwalk into an adulterous affair but must conceal their growing feelings or risk destroying the club they love. When an injured player from the A-team is selected to play with the Bs as part of his recovery, tensions are already high. Initial suspicion turns to physical lust for two of the team members and personal loyalties are stretched as they try to conceal the affair, not only from their own partners but also their teammates. Alexander Lincoln and Alexander King give magnetic performances as the lovers, alongside an excellent ensemble cast. Hard drinking and macho antics are par for the course amongst the team, but these bulky athletes soon reveal their vulnerabilities. Even if you've never played rugby, or even had a taste for it, you'll be drawn into the drama of these young men. Prepare yourself for a muddy, sweat-drenched emotional thrill ride.Ã‚Â—Brian Robinson. Minute for minute, you won't find a more handsome-packed film this year than British rugby drama In from the Side, a surprisingly moving sports-team story slathered in sweat, streaked with mud, and dripping with sexuality. As a ""B Squad"" of gay athletes tries to overcome inexperience and push past rivalries to score an elusive win, a secret affair simmers among them. Romantic Mark (puppy-eyed Alexander Lincoln) finds himself unable to avoid the blazing appeal of teammate Warren (Alexander King), who sets off every red (or in rugby, yellow) flag: the cocky attitude, the emotional unavailability, the long-term boyfriend. In From The Side dives deep into rugby-half macho battlefield, half tender brotherhood-but don't sweat the rules (or ""laws,"" which even the sport's fans find impenetrable): the real drama occurs off the field as infidelities, heartbreak, and unimpeded passions rule the day. A triumph for director Matt Carter-who shot, edited, co-wrote, and composed the music-In from the Side infuses every vivid frame with heat.",romance,"[[[223 222 227]

In a small town in central Oregon, Frank Weaver runs a meth lab out of an abandoned mine. While his young son Aiden waits outside the mine in his truck, Frank and an accomplice are attacked by an unseen creature. Investigating strange noises, Aiden is also attacked by the creature. Frank and Aiden survive their encounter with the creature and return home, where their condition quickly worsens. Frank sets up a locked room and demands that no matter what, Aiden's older brother Lucas keeps them locked inside. Having noticed alarming signs of physical and mental abuse on his fragile body, concerned Cispus Falls school teacher Julia suspects her young pupil Lucas knows a lot more than he lets on. Determined to get to the bottom of this mystery, the resilient tutor enlists the help of her sheriff brother Paul, only to come face to face with unspeakable evil and a malevolent monstrosity no man has ever seen before. A wendigo kills Kenny Glass and mauls Frank Weaver as the two men make meth in an abandoned coalmine. The mythical monster's bite causes Frank to begin a slow transformation into another wendigo. Believing his feral father can be saved if he completes the metamorphosis, Frank's yearold son Lucas secretly keeps Frank captive inside their remote house, partly to protect his sevenyearold brother Aiden, who eventually begins his own transformation after Frank attacks him.Having left town  years earlier to escape an abusive father, recovering alcoholic Julia Meadows returns to Cispus Falls to work as a schoolteacher. Julia temporarily moves in with her brother Paul, the town's current sheriff, which sparks several confrontations due to their troubled childhoods and Julia feeling guilty for abandoning Paul.Based on the boy's disturbing drawings and his strange story about a family of hungry bears becoming monsters, Julia takes an interest in Lucas's wellbeing. While attempting to bond with Lucas and investigating his home life, Julia becomes concerned that Lucas and his brother may also come from a broken family.",horror,"[[[ 9  7  8]

In exchange for lighter sentences, just like the anti-hero team in Suicide Squad (2016), a new batch of Belle Reve's meta-humans strike a deal with the cold head of Task Force X, Amanda Waller. This time, her ragtag band of super-powered convicts Harley Quinn, Bloodsport, Peacemaker, King Shark, Polka-Dot Man, and Ratcatcher 2 venture into the peril-laden South American island nation of Corto Maltese to find the Thinker: the evil scientist in charge of the mysterious Project Starfish. But, as the band joins forces with an old leader of the notorious team, humankind is on the verge of extinction. Can the expendable Suicide Squad stop the new menace that could mean the end of the world as we know it? The film opens at Belle Reve Penitentiary where Brian Durland/Savant (Michael Rooker) is in his break room throwing a ball around at targets that he has precisely set up. He even uses his skills to bounce the ball off the walls and kill a canary. He is then pulled away by Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) as she assigns him to a task.Savant is thrown into Task Force X/The ""Suicide Squad"" (also known as Team 2) alongside Blackguard (Pete Davidson), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Weasel (Sean Gunn), Mongal (Mayling Ng), Javelin (Flula Borg), The Detachable Kid/TDK (Nathan Filion), and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie). Led by Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), the team travels to the island of Corto Maltese for their mission. Upon arriving, Weasel falls into the water and apparently drowns since nobody knew he couldn't swim. When the Squad makes it to land, Blackguard steps out and reveals he brought the team to the mercenaries waiting for them on the beach. For his troubles, he gets his face blown off. Harley goes in blasting while Boomerang throws his signature weapon to slice some heads off. TDK's arms pop off so he can use them as (ineffective) weapons. The mercenaries retaliate and shoot TDK and Javelin dead. Mongal attempts to bring a chopper down but it crashes and she burns to death. Boomerang is impaled with wood and then shredded by the chopper's blades. Harley and Flag go missing while Savant attempts to flee the chaos. ",action,"[[[103 143 153]

304,tt7888964,"A docile family man slowly reveals his true character after his house gets burgled by two petty thieves, which, coincidentally, leads him into a bloody war with a Russian crime boss. Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life's indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody. When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon's McMafia)-and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again. Trapped in a mundane existence, Hutch Mansell, a glum, humble, workaday suburban father, is petrified when violent burglars break into his home, threatening his wife and children. In the wake of this soul-scarring incident, one good deed and several broken bones--and teeth--later, suddenly, imperfect Hutch summons up the courage to stand up for himself, only to find himself targeted by the murderous Russian drug lord, Yulian Kuznetsov, and his brutal henchmen. It seems that Mansell has a death wish; however, in this world, there are two kinds of people: wolves and lambs. The question is, which one is Hutch?

305,tt20850406,"An orphan soldier, Lieutenant Ram's life changes, after he gets a letter from a girl named Sita. He meets her and love blossoms between them. When he comes back to his camp in Kashmir,After he gets caught in jail, he sends a letter to Sita which won't reach her. Afreen is a student president of Pakistan at a university in London. She takes up the job of delivering a letter to Sita Mahalakshmi at the insistence of her grandfather's will. Though she doesn't like the job, she agrees to do it to get her share of her grandfather's property. The letter is written by Lieutenant Ram to Sita. In 1964, Ansari, a Pakistani extremist, does not approve of the brotherly relationship between Kashmiri Muslims and Hindus. He plans on severing the bond and separating them. He strongly believes that the Indian Army is the reason for the unity. He resorts to brainwashing teenagers in Pakistan and sends them to Kashmir. He advises them to live in disguise to make his plans work.In 1985, Afreen is a fierce Pakistani-based rabble-rouser in London, who dislikes anything about India. She sets fire to the car of an Indian philanthropist, Anand Mehta, in retaliation for burning Pakistan's flag. The management board of her university asks her to apologize to him. As Afreen doesn't like to say sorry to Indians, the philanthropist gives her two choices: either to give him 1 million (10 lac INR) as compensation or go to prison. Being a stubborn and unapologetic patriot, she decides to compensate him and goes back to Pakistan to meet her grandfather, Pakistan Army Brigadier Tariq, for giving her the money to compensate him. However, upon her arrival in Pakistan, she finds out that her grandfather passed away. In his will, he asks her to deliver a letter, which he could not, written in 1965, by Indian Army Lieutenant Ram to his lover, Sita Mahalakshmi of India. Upon successfully doing so, she will inherit his wealth. Though reluctant at first, Afreen agrees to deliver the letter to her, so that she can inherit Tariq's wealth.Afreen leaves for Hyderabad in search of Sita, where she is accompanied by Balaji, her senior at the university in London. She reaches the address, only to find that to be a ladies college. She asks Subramaniyam, who has been working there for more than 20 years, about Sita. He tells Afreen that the college was the royal palace of the Nawab of Hyderabad once which was donated by Princess Noor Jahan for the education of girls. He also adds that nobody with the name of Sita was there. Clueless, Afreen is unable to find Sita without any details. Upon getting an idea, she goes in search of Ram, instead, and learns about the address of Lt. Vikas Varma, who was in Ram's regiment, in Kashmir. Upon meeting Vikas, Afreen meets Ram's friend Durjoy Sharma and superior Vishnu Sharma, and learns about Ram's story.In 1964, Ansari, who sent teenagers to Kashmir, gives them the whereabouts of the Indian Army. After learning about them, Major Selvan orders the army to catch and kill the Pakistani teenagers, as they can compromise the safety of the Indians, in Kashmir. However, their plan backfires as Kashmiri Muslims, in the area, who thought of the youngsters as their own, attacked every soldier responsible for killing the youngsters. Knowing this would happen, Ansari steps over into Kashmir and brainwashes the Kashmiri Muslims. The enraged Muslims set fire on the houses of Kashmiri Pandits in Agarta. Aware that they are under the influence of Ansari, Ram tries to stop them, where he captures the informer and reveals the truth to the Kashmiri Muslims. After learning the truth, they apologize for trying to incite a religious riot and help the Indian Army in putting out the fires. This incident becomes national news, where Ram and his fellow regiment mates become national heroes.Vijayalakshmi, an investigative journalist arrives to interview them, through which she learns that Ram is an orphan. The next day, on the radio, she tells everybody about Ram and asks everyone in India to send their love to him. As a result, Ram receives a lot of letters from people across India, acknowledging him as their own brother and son. He is overjoyed to know that he has a big family and starts writing letters to reply to all of them. One of them is a letter, written by Sita Mahalakshmi, addressing him as her husband. He is surprised and regularly receives letters from her with no address. One day, Vikas and Ram take the same train as Sita, based on the minute details provided by her in the letters. He searches the entire train and is able to find her. He repeats a riddle, written in her letter, so that she can recognize him. He gives her his friend\'s landline number and leaves the train. Upon his arrival at his friend Durjoy Sharma's house, he gets to know that the phone has been dead for a week. Sita comes in search of Ram at Durjoy's house. They meet and Ram takes a picture of her, discreetly.Sita leaves yet again without giving him an address. Ram goes to a magic show in search of Sita and meets her friend, who reveals that Sita has been writing many letters to him, but posted only a few of them. He gets to know that Sita is a dance teacher, living in Princess Noor Jahan's palace in Hyderabad, to teach her Kathak. He enters the palace with the help of Subramaniyam and meets Sita. Ram learns that he saved her from riots, in Agarta, and that it was her first encounter with him. However, he was not able to see her face back then. It is later revealed that, Sita is none other than Princess Noor Jahan, whose marriage alliance is fixed with the Prince of Oman, in order to save her family\'s factories and businesses that were captured in Oman. She goes to bid her farewell to Ram, but ends up accompanying him the next four days, where they meet his family (the ones that wrote him the letters). Sita and Ram are spied by a journalist, who clicks their pictures together. Later, Ram drops off Sita at the palace and leaves to Kashmir. The pictures get published in the newspaper, revealing the Princess\'s love for a common man. Sita reveals to her brother that the news is true and cancels her alliance. She leaves to Kashmir for Ram. They spend some time together and Noor meets Ram's fellow mates as Sita. They meet Vishnu Sharma and his family at dinner. However, they are attacked by the youngster seeking vengeance for the earlier encounters. They capture him and obtain the precise location of Ansari. Ram promises the youngster that he will rescue his younger sister, Waheeda, from Ansari.The army plans a secret mission to gun down Ansari and warns the soldiers that if they get caught, they will be disowned by the army and declared as traitors. Ram, Vishnu Sharma and his team leave for the operation, by crossing the Indian border, and successfully execute Ansari. However, Brigadier Tariq gets alarmed by the fires that started as a result of the cross-firing, and starts for their location. Ram and his team are about to leave, when Ram hears a girl cry and realizes that it is Waheeda. He leaves to save her. However, Ram, along with Vishnu Sharma, are captured by the Pakistan Army, while the other soldiers escape successfully. Ram hands over Waheeda to Brigadier Tariq. They are tortured mercilessly to reveal the coordinates to the Indian Army base, in Kashmir, but the Brigadier Tariq takes pity on Ram and Vishnu and provides them with care. While using brute force, the Pakistani soldiers are able to get Vishnu to reveal the coordinates of the Indian army bases to them, in exchange for his freedom and not harming his family. Vishnu gets released, but they hang Ram, in order to demoralize the Indian army. The Indian army bases in Kashmir are destroyed, and Ram is branded as a traitor. Before his execution, Ram writes a letter to Sita and asks the Brigadier to deliver it to her.In 1985, Afreen learns that the Brigadier was, in fact, Tariq. Additionally, the child, whose life was saved by Ram during the fire, is Afreen herself. A changed Afreen, with a heavy heart, delivers the letter to Sita, through Balaji, where they learn about Ram's innocence and also finds the newspaper clipping attached to it, about ""Princess Noor Jahan of Hyderabad being in love with a common man"". Both Afreen and Balaji realize that Ram knew about Sita\'s true identity as a Muslim and did not care. With Ram\'s letter and Afreen, as evidence and witness, an inquiry is ordered on Vishnu Sharma and his regiment. Out of disgrace, he shoots himself with his service revolver. Sita manages to prove Ram's innocence and restores his name and honor in the Indian Army.",romance,"[[[255 255 255]

Together, Kevin, Stuart, Bob, and Otto - a new Minion sporting braces and a desperate need to please - deploy their skills as they and Gru build their first lair, experiment with their first weapons, and pull off their first missions. When the Vicious 6 oust their leader, legendary fighter Wild Knuckles (Alan Arkin), Gru interviews to become their newest member. It doesn't go well (to say the least), and only gets worse after Gru outsmarts them and suddenly finds himself the mortal enemy of the apex of evil. On the run, Gru will turn to an unlikely source for guidance, Wild Knuckles, and discover that even bad guys need a little help from their friends.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Universal Pictures. San Francisco, 1976.

But after the events of Minions (2015), a question arises. Do the fearless, denim-clad followers still have Mini Boss's back?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas"", ""The classic movie characters childhood is finally revealed. In the 70's, Gru's big dream was to be a villain. Then he met the minions Light hearted, pill shaped servants. When the Vicious 6 fire there leader, a job opens, leading Gru to his dream. But then Gru is kidnapped, and it's all up to 2015's greatest comedy idiots, Bob,Kevin and Strewart to save Gru, there leaderÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Bob-dog-11, A young male who dreams of becoming a villain must work together with his minions to defeat a group of villains from gaining ultimate power and taking control of everyone and everything. Along the way, he learns the true reality of becoming a real villain. The year 1976 is where the story begins. Belle Bottom, played by Taraji P. Henson, is a supervillain who is being pursued by the Anti-Villain League as she races across the city after stealing a map. Following her victory over the AVL agents, Belle makes her way to her hiding place at the Criminal Records record store. There, she meets the other members of her team, the Vicious 6, including their founder, Wild Knuckles, as well as members Strong Hold (Danny Trejo), Nun-Chuck (Lucy Lawless), Svengeance (Dolph Lundgren), and Jean-Clawed (Jean-Claude Van Damme) (Alan Arkin). They examine the map, and upon doing so, theydiscover that it details the location of an artifact known as the Zodiac Stone. Utilizing this artifact during the Chinese New Year transforms its users into powerful animals. The Vicious 6 traveled by plane to a remote island in search of the Stone. Wild Knuckles makes his way inside the temple and discovers the Zodiac Stone, but as soon as he does so, he is ambushed by a number of small metal guardians. He engages them in combat and then escapes the temple, only to discover that additional temple guards are pursuing him. The remaining five of the six pull Knuckles up, but then they steal the Stone from him and turn the tables on him, telling him that he is too old to lead the team and that they need new blood to take over instead. They cast Knuckles into the water and then take off into the sky. Young Gru, played by Steve Carell, is 11 years old and has always had the ambition of becoming a supervillain. As a result, the other children view him as a peculiar individual andavoid his company. Kevin, Bob, and Stuart are the ones who come to get him (all Pierre Coffin,along with the rest of the Minions). They make their way back to Gru's residence, where he discovers something that was sent to him in the mail. It is a message from Belle Bottom, as Gru had sent an application to join the Vicious 6 since he is their biggest fan, and Knuckles is his favorite villain. The context of the message is that Knuckles is Gru's favorite villain (or, was). Gru receives an invitation from Belle to attend an audition that will take place at the Criminal Records shop. Gru is ecstatic and believes that his time to shine as a supervillain has finally arrived. He is seen just living with his unsupportive mother Marlena, who is played by Julie Andrews, as well as the rest of the Minions that he has employed as his henchmen. He is seen just living with them. Gru relays the exciting news to the Minions, who enthusiastically rally behind their ""mini boss"" despite Gru's displeasure with the moniker.It has been discovered that Wild Knuckles is in fact still alive and is currently residing in his mansion along with three of his own goons (John DiMaggio, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Jimmy O. Yang). He hasn't gotten over the fact that the Vicious 6 kicked him off his own team, and now he's heard that they're looking for a new member to join them. This has made him verybitter. The following day, Gru makes it to Criminal Records, where he is introduced to a younger version of Dr. Nefario, played by Russell Brand and described as an ambitious mad scientist. He demonstrates one of his most recent creations to Gru, which is a rifle that fires a sticky green hand that can grab anything. Nefario hands it over to Gru and then walks him through the hidden passageway that leads to the Vicious 6's lair. However, when he finally meets them, they dismiss him for being a youngster because Jean-Clawed imagined that he was a tiny man when they were reviewing his application. As they walk away, another candidate walks in and tries to impress everyone with his pilot outfit, but his jetpack suddenly stops working, causing him tosoar erratically through the air. The Vicious 6 make an effort to stop him, which diverts their attention just as Gru discovers the Zodiac Stone hiding behind them. He steals the Stone by using the revolver that Nefario gave him, but the six of them find him and begin to pursue him. Gru catches up with the other minions and hands the Stone over to one of them, named Otto. Gru flees on his horse while the six warriors pursue him. He makes it so that Strong Hold and Nun-Chuck are unable to defend themselves, and when Belle and Svengeance grab a hold of Gru's bike, he uses the rocket to get them out from there as quickly as possible. Knuckles, who was there the whole time, now follows Gru around in his vehicle after seeing all that happened. Once Gru and the other Minions have returned to their home, they wait for Otto to return from work. When he does, he gives Gru a rock that has googly eyes attached to it as a gift. Otto addsthat he ended up going through a series of unfortunate events until he found up at a birthday party, at which point he traded the Stone for the pet rock that was being given away to the birthday boy. Because of Otto's mistake, Gru is fuming with rage, and he immediately fires all of the Minion workers. He sets off on his own to locate the Stone, but as he walks along the street,the goons working for Knuckles capture him and put him into their van, as Kevin watches from outside the window of the vehicle. He then proceeds to inform the other Minion workers that their mini boss has been taken hostage. Gru is taken to where Wild Knuckles has been hiding out. Knuckles is perturbed to discover that Gru is not in possession of the Stone, which causes Gru to be overjoyed at the prospect of meeting his hero. He calls Gru's house in an effort to coerce his mother into paying a ransom, but Kevin answers the phone instead. Knuckles tells him to bring the Stone to San Franciscowithin the next two days or they will kill Gru.Otto, Kevin, and Stuart go to the kid's house that Otto gave the Stone to, and Bob joins them there as well. The youngster explains that he handed it over to his uncle, who goes by the name RZA and is already riding away on a motorcycle. Otto and the other three Minions chase after him on a tricycle as they search for a bus for an advertisement to take them to San Francisco. They go to the airport, where they put on disguises and pretend to be pilots and a flight attendant in order to join the following flight. Kevin and Stuart make an attempt to fly, but they wind up messing everything up by pressing all of the buttons and making a whole mess ofthings before safely landing (sort of). Knuckles torments Gru by placing him in a gadget resembling a record player, which brings him closer and closer to saws that are rotating. He dispatches his underlings into the world, andthose underlings end up discovering the Minions. They attempt to seize them since they believethe Stone is in their possession, and as a result, they find themselves in Chinatown, where an acupuncturist named Master Chow (Michelle Yeoh) watches the goons beat on the Minions. Chow, despite her age and the fact that she is a little old lady, demonstrates remarkable kung fu skills and fights off the goons. Chow informs the Minions that she is no longer active in that line of work when they beg her to teach them her abilities. Nevertheless, she gives in after the three of them give her the puppy eye expression. After the incident, the henchmen decided to give up on Knuckles. After rescuing Gru from the trap, he puts Gru to work around the house. Knuckles drowns while he is in the process of cleaning his crocodile-filled pool. Knuckles is grateful that Gru was able to rescue him and drag him out of the pit in which he was trapped. He takes Gru along with him on the burglary. They pretend to be a grandfather and grandson so that they can rob the Bank of Evil. Knuckles acts as though he is having a heart attack so that Gru can steal the keys from Mr. Perkins' house (Will Arnett). Gru is successful in his attempt to steal the Mona Lisa, much to Knuckles' delight. Otto pursues the Biker on his tricycle through a number of states, but he is unable to keep up with him and eventually loses sight of him. Otto is eventually found by the Biker, who then takes him up, transports him to San Francisco on his motorcycle, and presents him with the Stone. Chow teaches the Minion gang various forms of martial arts, but more often than not, the Minion gang injures themselves rather than improving their skills. They are able to quickly improve their talents, despite Chow's assertion that they have only passed the basic training. Unfortunately, the Minions have already made their escape, and they are already traveling to help Gru. The Vicious 6 locate Gru's house, rip off its roof, and then question Marlena and the other Minions about the whereabouts of Gru. The fact that Gru was kidnapped by Knuckles is revealed by one of the Minions. The group of six then travels to Knuckles' residence, where they proceed to rip the roof off, search the property thoroughly, and come up empty-handed. When Knuckles and Gru return, they find that Gru's home has been demolished. He is angry because he is aware that the 6 were the ones who did this, and he is frustrated that they wouldstill try to injure him after all of this time has passed. In spite of Gru's protests, he breaks the news to him that he is given up and just instructs him to go back home. A parade celebrating the Chinese New Year is currently taking place downtown. Otto ultimately causes a commotion by dashing into the crowd. Gru spies him as he is on the trolley and immediately starts chasing after him. Otto reveals the Stone to Gru, who then professes his admiration for Otto. Regrettably, the Vicious 6 have managed to catch up to them, and nowhave Gru in their custody. In the nick of time, just as they are about to be surrounded by theAnti-Villain League, Belle seizes the Stone and uses its abilities to transform both her and the crew into enormous animal monsters. Strong Hold transforms into a bull, Nun-Chuck into a snake, Svengeance into a tiger, and Jean-Clawed into a monstrous monkey. Belle transforms into a dragon that breathes fire (with his lobster claw arm). They seize Gru and bind him to the hands of a clock tower, which will gradually rip him to pieces over time. Knuckles, Kevin, Stuart, and Bob all appear to come to Gru's rescue at the same time. The three are reincarnated as a rabbit, a chicken, and a ram after being transformed by Belle. Despite the fact that Knuckles puts up a valiant effort, Belle is able to defeat him with her fire breath. The three individuals recall what Chow had said and let loose their inner animals; they then proceed to defeat the mutated version of Vicious 6. Gru is set free by Otto, and he immediately heads off to assist his buddies. The three Minions easily dispatch the six, and Gruseizes the Stone, which he then employs to transform his opponents into rats. They were taken into arrest by the AVL when they arrived. Knuckles suffers an injury and is subsequently detained; nonetheless, he assures Gru that they will meet again in the near future. The scene then cuts to a funeral, where it would appear that Knuckles has passed away. Gru delivers a heartfelt eulogy for him, only to later discover that Knuckles staged his own death andis in hiding. Following the performance of the Minion version of ""You Can't Always Get What You Want,"" Gru is reunited with his idol, and the two of them continue their journey into the sunset with the remaining Minions. During the roll of credits, Gru leads the rehired Minions to the Criminal Records business, which has the appearance of being closed. Gru asks Dr. Nefario whether he would be interested in officially working for him and building gadgets, but Nefario responds by saying that he is retiring from the criminal underworld. After Gru and the Minions have successfully persuaded him withtheir puppy eyes, he reveals a surprise to Gru, which is the rocket car that Gru is seen driving as an adult. The newly formed evil crew immediately sets its sights on committing even more heinous acts",comedy,"[[[255 141  69]

Several years after the Na'vi repelled the RDA invasion Jake Sully and his family are living on Pandora. Things seem peaceful but the RDA has other plans, invading and capturing Pandora. Sully forms a guerrilla group to try to expel the invaders. Pandora, 2170. Having found meaning and purpose in the heart of the extrasolar Garden of Eden, formerly paraplegic Marine veteran Jake Sully and his fierce warrior princess companion Neytiri enjoy peace and prosperity after the life-altering events of Avatar (2009). But happiness is fleeting. And when the unsightly ghosts of Sully's past emerge, sixteen years after the all-out Assault on the Tree of Souls, the human Toruk Makto and the Na'vi must fight back. Now, Jake and the Omatikaya clan have no choice but to pick up where they left off to defend their home. In the upcoming war against the unstoppable Sky People, will blind revenge destroy everything Sully holds dear? Over a decade after the events of the first film, the film begins with Jake Sully narrating his modest and peaceful life as Chief of the Omaticaya Clan and raising a family with his wife Neytiri, which includes his sons Neteyam and Lo'ak and his daughter Tuk, his adopted daughter Kiri (born from Grace Augustine's comatose Na'vi avatar), and a human boy named Spider, the son of Miles Quaritch who was born on Pandora but was unable to be transported to Earth in cryostasis as an infant. While Jake is able to accept Spider as an adopted son, Neytiri is distrustful of him given his human origins. However, all the children mingle and socialize well with each other including Spider, whom Kiri is affectionate with even though he is a human. Spider does not embrace his human heritage and feels more inclined to Na'vi culture and traditions. They lead a normal life until one day they notice a strange star in the night sky. Much to their dismay, they realize its a RDA space-ship with humans returning to Pandora to colonize it, erecting a new main operating base yet again, causing significant destruction to Pandora. Among the new arrivals in the ship is Colonel Quaritch, who has been cloned into a Na'vi body and with his memories uploaded from before his death. As a result, Quaritch is unable to remember his demise at the hands of Jake but is only able to recollect the events in the past and his vengeful mission to eliminate Jake.",action,"[[[255 255 255]

Meanwhile, the Tamil Nadu government gets intel that a major terrorist event is planned in Chennai.Along with Preethi and her boss Dominic Irudhayaraj, Veera visits the East Coast mall, which is their last client where he observes a series of suspicious activities and deduces that someone else has taken over the mall. Veera is proven right, as terrorists, led by Umar Farooq's brother Umar Saif, open fire and hijack the mall. Veera, Preethi, Dominic and others hide unharmed inside an unopened restaurant. The government, led by Deputy National Security Advisor Althaf Hussain, tries to negotiate with the terrorists, who demands the release of Farooq.

A Disney+ Original movie, ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" is a reimagining of the 2003 hit family comedy. It is the story of the raucous exploits of a blended family of 12, the Bakers, as they navigate a hectic home life while simultaneously managing their family business. Without a doubt, raising twelve children while juggling a career and a hectic home life can be a challenging task. Indeed, Paul and Zoey Baker, who already struggle to bring order to their lovely blended family, have their plate full. And, as if that weren't enough, a tempting, lucrative business proposition comes out of the blue, ushering in a new lifestyle, extra responsibilities, and unforeseen complications. Can the Bakers survive the side effects of success?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas"", 'The Bakers are a blended family that began with Paul Baker (Zach Braff) and his wife Kate (Erika Christensen) (who dreams about expanding her yoga studio) who together had daughters Ella (Kylie Rogers) (Wants to be a social media Influencer) and Harley (Caylee Blosenski) (wants her punk band to go viral) and their adopted son Haresh (Aryan Simhadri) (who wants to be a music player) after their friends died in a car accident. Kate and Paul got married after she got pregnant in college. As time went on, Kate felt suffocated in the relationship with Paul. Kate eventually divorced Paul, but they remained friends with Kate acting as an occasional, though slightly inattentive, babysitter.Zoey (Gabrielle Union) married football player Dominic ""Dom"" Clayton (Timon Durrett) and had daughter Deja (Journee Brown) (wants to play basketball) and son DJ (Andre Robinson) (who wants to be a Lego designer and a comic book artist). Due to Dom's celebrity life, Zoey divorced him and took custody of the kids.Paul met Zoey after she visited his small restaurant and suggested that he make the entire menu breakfast themed all day. The two eventually got married, expanded the restaurant, renamed it Baker's Breakfast and had two sets of twins: Luca (Leo Abelo Perry) and Luna (Mykal-Michelle Harris), and Bronx (Sebastian Cote) and Bailey (Christian Cote).Dom continues to be active in Deja and DJ's lives which slightly intimidates Paul as he was rarely there to begin with. While Deja prepares for her basketball scholarship, DJ feels that he connects with Paul more than Dom and would rather speak with him. Deja has a successful game in front of a scout and when Paul offers to celebrate, she decides to go for a 1:1 lunch with Dom instead.Paul gets a meeting with a large company to expand his restaurant. He succeeds and has his famous sauce (that tastes Sweet, Salty and Savory depending on what you put it on) sold on shelves. The investors Melanie and Michelle buy out the company name and brand in exchange for the funding. He decides to use the money to move the family and their pet dogs Bark Obama and Joe Bitin' from Los Angeles to Calabasas, in a bigger house in a gated community. Deja is not happy as she would have to move to a new team. As the sauce gets popular, the investors propose an expansion plan, which means more work for Paul.Upon arrival, Zoey begins to feel the effects of racial profiling, especially after meeting her neighbor Anne (June Diane Raphael). Paul suddenly gets a call informing him that his sister Rachel (Cynthia Murell) has checked into rehab, forcing him to take in his nephew Seth (Luke Prael), who has had a habit of being a thief. The kids are not happy about this decision, but they are not given a choice. Seth bonds with Haresh when he discovers that he is being picked on at the new school because of his ethnicity and teaches him to defend himself. Deja begins seeing a boy named Chris (Simeon Daise) and sneaks out of the house to see him.Paul finds himself having to travel to look for new places to expand his restaurant. The investors Melanie (Brittany Daniel) and Michele (Cynthia Daniel Hauser) also insist on altering some of his business ideals to cut costs. They also insist that Paul changes the brand name, as it is confusing with chains with a similar sounding name. He starts to miss out on being with his family which upsets Zoey as this was the reason she divorced Dom. Deja doesn't get game time, as the new coach keeps benching her in favor of other white kids on the team. On DJ's birthday, Paul rushes to get home. During the party, things start to get out of hand as DJ changes his look to impress a girl, Haresh and Seth are suspended from school for a week after starting a fight with the kids who bullied Haresh, and Anne profiles Zoey's family for a series of recent break-ins. Upon Paul arriving, Deja reveals that she quit the basketball team and that the entire family has been unhappy since arriving in Calabasas. Feeling that Zoey can no longer handle their kids, Dom announces that he wants full custody of Deja and DJ.Harley and Ella accuse Seth of the break-ins after Haresh pointed out that he saw him stealing from the restaurant cash register, though he returned it and he angrily leaves. Upon realizing their mistake, the Bakers, Kate, and Dom all go out and find Seth. They apologize and admit that he is part of the family and he rejoins them.Back at home, Paul and Dom discuss their different upbringings; while Paul will never know what it is like to be at a disadvantage, Dom has to understand that being away from his kids has made him distant and that he needs to be more attentive. Realizing how much his family means to him, Paul breaks his deal with the company so that he can run the restaurant himself. The Bakers move back to Los Angeles and buy a new house. While having dinner, or rather breakfast, at the newly named Baker's Dozen Breakfast, Paul reveals the design of the sauce bottle has changed to reflect the family, Seth included.The end credits show Dom, Paul, and Zoey were able to invest their sauce and went National. Kate invented bird yoga. Seth moved back in with his mom after she got out of rehab, but still spends lots of time with his cousins. Deja and Chris soon started their freshman years at USC. Ella became the social manager for Harley's punk band and a video of her band playing at her school talent show broke the internet. Luna and Luca won the tennis national under 12 division becoming like Venus and Serena. DJ, Talia, and Dom went to Comic-Con and bonded while Dom realized he liked Thor.",comedy,"[[[74 74 66]

318,tt10473036,"A streetwise cat and his gang of rats come up with the perfect money making scheme. Maurice is a sassy, street-smart cat with a sneaky disposition. Together with his band of rats and pied-piper friend Keith, he travels across the countryside, swindling villagers with a staged rat plague. All seems well when the gang sets its sights on a scenic market town, though they quickly realize that something more nefarious is afoot. Maurice tells a town of people that they have a plague of rats, illustrated by various rats terrorizing the townsfolk and convinces them to pay for Keith, the pied piper, to lead them outside of the town. Outside the town, the rats are revealed to be sentient and literate, working with Keith and Maurice to defraud towns.They are heading to the town of Bad Blintz next which suffers from a lack of food and where rat catchers have been unable to find the reason of the disappearing food. Trying to infiltrate the tunnels under the city, the rats notice that there are no local rats despite traces of them. They find a trap that captures rats alive and Darktan, their leader, is trapped inside. Meanwhile, Maurice has entered the mayor's house and when Keith tries to find him, they meet the mayor's daughter, Malicia, who quickly deduces - after seeing tap-dancing rat Sardines - that they are behind the recent plague of rats in nearby towns and enlists them to help discover the reason behind the city's food shortage.Their quest leads them to the local rat catchers headquarters where they find a secret passage to the basement filled with food. Tehy also find Darktan and the other rats coming from the tunnels with the trap they found. Maurice correctly guesses that the rat catchers are trying to catch the rats alive to use them for entertainment, pitting dogs in rings with rats and betting on how fast they are killed. The rat catchers catch Sardines and use him for the ring but he is rescued by the others.Poisoning the food with laxatives, Maurice, Keith and Malicia manage to force the rat catchers to admit that they created a rat king when eight rats they left in a bucket got their tails knotted and developed an evil sentience, capable of controlling other rats. Maurice flees from the rat king while Keith and Malicia head to the woods to find the real pied piper and steal his magical flute, the only instrument known to kill a rat king. Meanwhile, the Big Boss, revealed to be the rat king in a pile of human clothes, has captured Peaches, one of the rats and Dangerous Beans, the groups spiritual leader, tries to rescue her. Confronting the rat king in the rat catchers' office, Maurice appears and hits him with the money they swindled, allowing him to escape with the two rats.In the woods, Keith and Malicia attempt to steal the flute from the sleeping piper but he wakes up and tries to kill them by forcing them to enter the burning oven. They are saved when the wind-up toy mouse Malicia previously took from Darktan distracts him long enough to lose the flute, allowing them to run back to town with the flute.Meanwhile, Maurice and the rats try to flee the city but are stopped by the rat king who summons dozens of rats from all directions to make himself stronger. Maurice runs into the woods to find the two humans while the rats are attempting to resist the rat king's call to merge with him. Keith and Malicia return and after some initial hurdles, he manages to play the flute correctly to beguile the rats away from the rat kings influence until only the king itself remains. The rat king uses the last of his power to freeze everyone in place but Dangerous Beans manages to break free, defying him again. The rat king then telepathically snaps his neck. Laying dying, Dangerous Beans reminds Maurice to be a cat and he uses his bottled up instincts to attack and kill the rat king, mortally wounding himself in the process. When Death and the Death of Rats arrive to take Dangerous Beans and one of Maurice lives, he successfully trades one of his lives for Dangerous Beans' life, allowing both of them to wake up.The rat king defeated and the food given back to the townspeople, the town and the rats come to an agreement. The rats get to live in the middle of town and Bad Blintz becomes a tourist attraction with its talking rats, including a job for Keith as the official town's piper.",comedy,"[[[254 252 255]

320,tt5843876,"A high-school transfer student finds a new passion when she begins to work on the school's newspaper. 17-year-old Henry Page has never been in love. He fancies himself a romantic, but the kind of once-in-a-lifetime love he's been hoping for just hasn't happened yet. When he meets transfer student Grace Town on the first day of senior year, all that might be about to change. When Grace and Henry are chosen to co-edit the school paper, he is immediately drawn to the mysterious newcomer. As he learns the heartbreaking secret that has changed her life, he finds himself falling in love with her--or at least the person he thinks she is.Ã‚Â—Amazon Studios. In a voice-over narration, high school senior Henry Page (Austin Abrams) tells us how he has a pretty typical life and wants to be a writer, hoping to be the editor of the school paper. He is called to the school office by the principal Mr. Sharma (Adhir Kalyan) and introduced to Grace Town (Lili Reinhart), a transfer student who walks with a cane. He says they are both great writers and would be a perfect editor-in-chief duo for the paper, but Grace says she doesn't want to and leaves.After the meeting, Henry misses his bus, so Grace offers to give him a ride home - she then admits she doesn't like driving and lets Henry drive her car, and she ends up giving him her book of Neruda poems. Grace notes that Henry lives in a much nicer house than she does. At home, Henry's family, adult older sister Suds (Sarah Jones), dad Toby (Bruce Altman), and mom Gloria (Meg Gibson) are all thrilled he got the editor job.Mr. Sharma reveals to Henry that something changed Grace's mind and she is joining the paper. He tells them they need to come up with a theme for the paper's final issue. Grace tells Henry she's taking an assistant editor position, and she will edit but will not write anything. Later, Henry talks to Grace about the poem he read - and again misses his bus. They ride home together again. Grace walks home, and Henry sees a man come and get the car to drive it home.After again bringing Henry home, he asks her to hang out. She can't at the time but makes plans for the evening - she comes back and takes Henry out through a long winding woodland path to an old cotton mill that shut down years ago. Inside is a pond with fish that Grace likes to feed. They wade into the water, and Grace asks Henry if he's ever had a girlfriend, which he hasn't. She reveals she did a lot of her physical therapy in a car after the car wreck she was in. When Henry asks her more questions, she says she has to get going and asks if he can find his way home.At home, Henry glues together broken pottery, a Japanese art form that is a hobby of his. Suds comes home - she's living at home after a horrible breakup with her boss at the hospital, and she cries and Henry comforts her. At the urging of some of his friends, Henry follows Grace after school to see where she goes every day. He watches as she picks flowers and goes to a cemetery, where she sits at a grave, leaves the flowers, and speaks to it. After she leaves, Henry looks and sees the name Dominic Sawyer. Henry googles him and discovers he was Grace's boyfriend who was killed in the same accident she was injured in.His friend Muz texts him that Grace was spotted doing something weird, so Henry goes to the high school where he sees Grace on the track trying to run but limping. She falls, screams, and beats her leg with her cane. The next day, Grace tells Henry her idea for the theme for the last issue - ""teenage limbo"". Henry tells the paper staff they need to dig deep for real true stories, and Grace asks him to start. He opens up about a friend who committed suicide. Later, Henry asks Grace why she won't write anymore, and she explains she was asked to write a eulogy and couldn't find the words.Henry and Grace spend more time together and bond. He invites her to a Halloween party and she says yes. He\'s surprised after when she comes in to hang out and doesn\'t go to the cemetery for once. They begin to kiss but when the song playing in Henry's room is the song that plays in Grace's car, she gets very upset and storms out. She confesses to him about Dominic and says it was their song. She kisses Henry but says she's messed up and can't do this, and that she's not one of his vases.Henry's friends convince him begrudgingly to go to the Halloween party anyway where he smokes weed. He's surprised to see Grace there - he brings her a drink. Meanwhile, Henry's friend La (Kara Young) finally gets together with Cora (Coral Pena) the girl who had burned her before. Henry and Grace dance then eventually make out in Henry's room. She takes off her costume and he sees her leg scars. He admits he's never had sex before, and the two sleep together.The next morning, Grace wakes up and begins crying, startling Henry, who leaves her a panicked voicemail. But she responds that she thought it was cute, and finally drives her car herself to come pick him up. She takes him Dominic\'s memorial site, where she tells Henry she needed him to come with her for support. She puts her necklace Dominic gave her on the memorial, and tells Henry she wants to move on. She begins brightening up, finally eating with the school paper crew at lunch and fully dating Henry.One day at home a different car is in Grace's driveway - she tells Henry to stay outside and goes in. Shortly after, a woman runs out, gets in the car, and drives out in a hurry, backing over the garbage cans on the way out. Henry asks Grace if that was her mom but she says it doesn't matter. When he presses her, she snaps back at him to stop trying to fix her. Grace doesn't show up to school later, and Henry hears it's the anniversary of the accident and a candlelight vigil is being held. Henry runs to her house in the rain, where a man named Martin lets him in. He lets Henry wait in her room - which Henry realizes is Dominic\'s room.Grace arrives and reveals the truth - she lives with Dominic\'s family. She moved in a month before the accident to get away from her mom who was drinking and in bad shape. Henry sees that Grace went back for the necklace she left at his memorial, and that she wears Dominic's clothes. Henry is angry and upset feeling that she's leading him on and not moving on, and Grace says she's giving him as much as she can and she can't pretend to be better because he wants her to be. Henry tells her he loves her, but seeing all of the photos of Grace and Dominic all over, leaves dejected.When he gets home, his parents try to talk to him but he tells them they don't understand. Suds talks with him and he tells her the truth, and she explains how medically a breakup will feel like withdrawal, but that his body chemistry will adjust and go back to normal. He says he wishes he could take it all back, but Suds says he can't - Grace is a part of him now. Henry goes to Dominic's grave, takes the poem Grace had him read and burns it.At school, Henry gets a text from Martin that Grace is missing. Henry races to the secret pond and finds Grace sobbing in the water. She calls Henry Dominic and says over and over that it should have been her, that the accident was her fault and she shouldn't have been teasing him she just wanted to make him laugh. Henry says it's okay and hugs her. She seems to snap out of it, realizing it's Henry, and she tells him that when the crash happened her last thought was ""shit"", it wasn't even about Dom, and she wonders if that makes her a bad person. He assures her it doesn't. She asks what Dom's last thought was, and Henry says it was of her.Grace takes a collection of her Dominic belongings and drops them into the pond, then strips her dress off, explaining she was going to marry Dominic in it, and Henry takes her home. At school, Mr. Sharma tells the paper that Grace is taking time off and when she comes back will not be returning to the paper. Grace eventually returns to school but he stays away from her. For his final essay for the paper, Henry says that every person has felt the loneliness and scariness of being a teenager. He says that scars are not a sign of what has been broken, but rather what has been created.On the last day of school, Grace and Henry finally talk about their future plans. He's going to Bennington, and she's taking a year off to continue therapy. She says she needs to find her words again, and he assures her she will. She tells him he's extraordinary and kisses him on the cheek, and they hug goodbye - she slips something into his pocket. He checks his pocket and finds the poem he burned put back together, exactly like he does with his vases. He leaves school, missing the bus, but his friends ditch the bus to walk home with him one last time.",romance,"[[[165 153 137]

An elite Navy SEAL uncovers an international conspiracy while seeking justice for the murder of his pregnant wife in Tom Clancy's Without Remorse, the explosive origin story of action hero John Clark  one of the most popular characters in author Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan universe. When a squad of Russian soldiers kills his family in retaliation for his role in a topsecret op, Sr. Chief John Kelly Michael B. Jordan pursues the assassins at all costs. Joining forces with a fellow SEAL Jodie TurnerSmith and a shadowy CIA agent Jamie Bell, Kelly's mission unwittingly exposes a covert plot that threatens to engulf the U.S. and Russia in an allout war. Torn between personal honor and loyalty to his country, Kelly must fight his enemies without remorse if he hopes to avert disaster and reveal the powerful figures behind the conspiracy. In Aleppo, a team of US Navy SEALs, including Senior Chief John Kelly, rescue a CIA operative taken hostage by a suspected proAssad paramilitary group. The situation escalates as the SEALs discover that the captors are actually Russian military. Three months later, in apparent retaliation for their role in the mission, several members of the team are covertly killed by Russian FSB operatives. Kelly's pregnant wife Pam is murdered when the Russians break into their house. Kelly kills all but one of the attackers before being rushed to the hospital with nearfatal wounds.Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Kelly's SEAL team leader and friend, Lt. Commander Karen Greer, meets with CIA officer Robert Ritter and Secretary of Defense Thomas Clay to discuss how the FSB discovered the SEALs' identities and review their response options. Leaked news of Russia's unprecedented attack on American soil has caused the alreadystrained relationship between the two nations to sour further, possibly causing a new cold war. The CIA refuses to conduct an investigation into the murders, motivating Greer to pass confidential information to Kelly.Healed from his injuries, Kelly tracks down the Russian diplomat, who issued the passports to the FSB operatives, and forces him to give up the name of the surviving assassin before killing him. Sent to prison for murder, Kelly bargains his way out by revealing the escaped operative is Victor Rykov, an exSpetznaz officer who is hiding in Murmansk, Russia. Greer recommends against letting Kelly participate in Rykov's capture, Clay overrules her on the condition that Kelly serves his sentence after the mission.",action,"[[[112 137 144]

Hopeful of changing his life with a miracle, sad-eyed Italian woodcarver Geppetto puts the finishing touches on his latest creation. And having put his heart into making the wooden Pinocchio marionette, the lonely artisan takes a step back and makes a wish on a bright star. But the universe always listens to a longing heart. As a result, the mysterious magic of the benevolent Blue Fairy takes over, granting Geppetto's wish in the dead of night. As the effervescent essence of life reanimates the newly built puppet, innocent Pinocchio has everything he needs to be a boy. Now he is the living proof that no request is too extreme. However, can smiling Pinocchio prove himself brave, truthful, and unselfish?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas. Late one night in a small Italian village, Jiminy Cricket enters the home of elderly woodcarver Geppetto, accompanied by his pet kitten Figaro and fish Cleo. Geppetto has completed work on a marionette puppet which he names Pinocchio. Before retiring to bed, Geppetto makes a wish on a star.A few hours later, the star magically brings Pinocchio to life and he is soon visited by the Blue Fairy, who tells him that if he acts brave, truthful and selfless, he can be a real boy. The Blue Fairy also appoints Jiminy the responsibility of being Pinocchio's conscience to teach him right from wrong.When Geppetto awakens and finds Pinocchio alive, he is at first shocked, but becomes overjoyed. After a few days, Geppetto decides that Pinocchio should attend school and sends him there. However, Pinocchio is soon approached by con-artist fox and cat duo ""Honest"" John and Gideon as they convince him that he should live a life of fame in order to truly be a real boy, when they really want to sell him to the puppet master Stromboli in exchange for wealth.When Jiminy, with the help of a seagull named Sofia, convinces him to continue going to school, Pinocchio is thrown out on account of being a puppet. Pinocchio decides to go to Stromboli's after all with Jiminy unable stop him when John places a glass jar over him.At Stromboli's theater, Pinocchio befriends one of Stromboli's employees Vitelli and her puppet Sabina. Pinocchio puts on a good show for the crowd but Stromboli locks him in a bird cage to prevent him from ever leaving, wanting to exploit Pinocchio for all he's worth. Soon, Stromboli's coach ends up freeing Jiminy from the jar and when he enters the coach, he manages to help Pinocchio escape when Pinocchio has him reach the keys to the lock on the cage by telling lies since that makes his nose grow. Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo go out to look for Pinocchio when he fails to come home for dinner.Soon, Pinocchio is swiped up by a coach full of children driven by a charismatic Coachman, who is taking the boys and girls to Pleasure Island, an isle where misbehavior is encouraged. When they reach the island, Pinocchio slowly gets disturbed by the amount of cruelty the kids commit, much to the bemusement of an unruly boy named Lampwick. When Jiminy, who got separated from Pinocchio again, makes it to the island, he soon finds out that the boys and girls there get turned into donkeys and the Coachman sells them to the salt-mines with help from his fog-like henchmen. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick get transformed himself at a pool hall and he and Jiminy escape the island before the Coachman and his goons can get them, but not before Pinocchio gains a donkey's ears and tail.Pinocchio and Jiminy make it back to Geppetto's but find that he's not home because Sofia gave him a flyer of Pleasure Island to let him know where Pinocchio is and that he sold all of his clocks to buy a boat to go there. While trying to find Geppetto, Pinocchio reunites with Vitelli and Sabina, who tell him that Stromboli has been arrested and they have taken over his puppet show. They offer Pinocchio to join them, but Pinocchio declines, wanting to save his father, which makes his donkey parts disappear. Sofia pulls a rope for Pinocchio to hold out to the sea, where they soon find Geppetto in his boat. Just as they reunite, they are swallowed by a giant sea monster named Monstro. They take refuge in a giant boat in Monstro's stomach, and Pinocchio gets the idea to make him sneeze by starting a fire within him. The plan is successful, and Monstro sneezes them out, but he gives a chase that ends with him and the group crashing on dry land and rendering Geppetto unconscious.Pinocchio thinks Geppetto has died, and despairs before Geppetto comes to and soon tells Pinocchio that despite being a puppet, he has proven himself to be a true boy at heart for all that he's done and they depart for home.

331,tt28073548,"A seaplane pilot flying in the tropics finds herself falling for the man sent to sink her business. Dana Randall Delta Goodrem is the pilot for the tiny Queensland company which aids people in the remote area, both for the people living there and for visiting tourists. Her dad Jeff Roy Billing chides her for blowing off highpaying visitors to transport a resident's dog who had been bitten by a snake and would die if it did not receive timely medical care to the vet, as their bills are mounting.William Mitchell Joshua Sasse is sent all the way from London by ITCM Financial, his father Duncan's Hugh Parker UK investment firm, to the tropics of Australia to shut down Fullerton Airways. He'd researched companies they have been backing, and pinpoints the small, flailing, familyrun seaplane business as ideal for liquidation as it lacks income. He's given a week to visit the company, go over their financial in person and return to the board meeting to shut them down, proving to his father he's ready to move up in the company.nDuncan says that if William does a good job, he will be made Junior Director at the company.Nikki Steph Tisdell, Fullerton's airplane mechanic, pushes Dana to find time to date but she insists she's too busy. Dana is dedicated to keeping Fullerton airways going as this was her dead mother's vision and wish.nThe next morning, Jeff warns them a rep from ITCM Financial is coming for an inspection. Dana is asked to pick up Will from the ferry, and initially they have a testy relationship. Jeff goes out of his way to try and impress William.nShe is quick to defend their remote air support, although Jeff tries to downplay it. William says that Government subsidizes the cost of fuel for the remote air support flights. But since Fullerton Airways has only one operational plane, it doesn't leave much room for profits.Dana whizzes Will around to a community off the coast of farnorth Queensland to deliver parcels to people in need, which she visits every two weeks as otherwise they'd be totally cut off. The plane is  years old, and William is claustrophobic.nAgain, they convince him to accompany her on her rounds a second day. This time the engine kicks out, but luckily Dana manages to keep her cool and lands the plane safely. She fixes the problem and the plane flies again.Afterwards, having drinks in Fullerton, Dana's ex Heath Simon Brook McLachlan sees her chemistry with Will and both he and Nikki encourage her to pursue him. So, they spend time together while crossing the tarmac, stargazing and sharing stories about their lives. Dana shares how much her family, and she are connected with the community. This is her purpose is life.A third day of helping Dana, and Will's father loses patience with him. William was supposed to have audited the financial by now, but he hadn't even started yet, as he was busy helping Dana.nWill tries to convince Duncan that they were wrong to want to write off the small aeronautical company, but Nikki overhears. Dana is chewing out over the news when confirmation of an impending cyclone reaches them.Will helps Dana find an injured Jeff, who'd been trying to help others seek safety against the cyclone. The threeperson staff of Fullerton Airways hole up with Will in the hangar's storage room to wait out the storm. He pledges to fight for their company at his headquarters, as he cares about Dana.The next morning, after the storm has passed, Will helps Dana deliver emergency supplies to many remote locations. Working hard all day, by nightfall she has made peace with him. However, as they're closing up the hanger for the night, Jeff announces that ITCM Financial has sent an email, shutting them down immediately.William has returned to London and has been unsuccessful in swaying the board. Dana arrives unannounced, armed with a plan to revamp and expand Fullerton Airways. In response to Duncan's negative response, Will resigns and offers himself to Dana to aid them in their expansion.ITCM Financial backs their endeavor, and Fullerton Airways is shown to have expanded and now has a more professional look, with Will happily installed there with the company and Dana, as the two had fallen for each other.",romance,"[[[185 230 197]

LeBron gets the help of Bugs Bunny and the Looney Tunes to win the basketball game and get his son back.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Joe"", 'In 1998, 3 years after the events of Michael Jordan's adventure with the Looney Toons, LeBron Raymone James wants to play basketball. but at the same time, he enjoys playing games on his Game-Boy. his coach convinces him that the games he plays that are not basketball are distracting him from what he is really good at and that he has to quit gaming if he wants to work harder, LeBron takes his advice and scraps the Game-Boy.23 years pass since the scrapping of the Game-Boy and 18 years pass after the events of DJ Drake's adventure with the Looney Toons, now a Basketball champion, NBA superstar and global icon LeBron Raymone James Sr. wishes for both of his sons, Darius and Dominic, to follow in his footsteps, but Dom, a child prodigy in computer software, instead dreams of becoming a video game developer. LeBron's wife, Kamiyah, advises him to respect Dom's wish. While showing an interest in Dom's game, Dom discovers a glitch in his character after performing a specific move which causes the character to be deleted and the game to crash, to his chagrin.Later, LeBron is invited with his family to the Warner Brothers Animation Group Inc. company studio in Hollywood, Los Angeles to discuss a movie deal to experiment with the latest film-making technology, but LeBron dismisses the idea, while Dom shows an interest in the studio's software, particularly its state-of-the-art algorithm. Dom develop and expresses an interest in a future with Warner Bros, leading to a blowup argument with his father at basketball camp when LeBron refuses to let him give up on the sport. meanwhile, the dark evil living computer Artificial Intelligence algorithm named King Alfred G. ""Al-G"" Rhythm who lives in a top secret digital cyber-galactic multiverse known as the ""Seververse"" inside the computer of the Warner Bros' Computer Laboratory Room which holds all of the Warner Bros' Cinematic Universes, who has secretly become self-aware and desires more recognition from the world, lures the two to the basement and traps them in virtual reality in the Seververse. Taking Dom as his prisoner, he orders LeBron to assemble a basketball team made entirely from fictional characters owned by Warner Bros to compete against his own team in a day's time, telling him that he will only be released if he wins, and sends him through the virtual cyberspace of the Seververse where he lands in the ""Toon World"" Cinematic Universe. Meanwhile, Al-G talks to Dom and begins to turn him against his father by playing on his resentments and helping him develop and upgrade himself and his game, which he secretly intends to use against LeBron.LeBron finds Toon World deserted save only for Bugs Bunny, who explains that Al-G persuaded the rest of the Looney Tunes to leave their world and explore other realities and cinematic universes. Using the Martian Maggot UFO spaceship belonging to Marvin the Martian and his Martian dog K-9, LeBron and Bugs travel to different Cinematic Universes based on Warner Bros properties such as DC Comics, Harry Potter, Matrix, Casablanca and Game of Thrones to locate and recruit the rest of the Looney Toons, such as Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny and Porky Pig, into the ""Toon Squad.""Over Bugs' objections, LeBron insists on coaching his new players on the fundamentals of basketball and gets quite bossy to try make them play like him. The Tune Squad meet with Al-G's team, the Goon Squad, comprised of monstrous upgraded CGI avatars of several active professional basketball players with monstrous superpowers and led by Dom. Al-G also upgrades the Toon Squad, transforming them into real animals. To further the stakes, Al-G live-streams the game and abducts countless viewers, including LeBron's family, into the Seververse's virtual reality, and says that if the Toon Squad loses, the viewers will remain there trapped for eternity and the Looney Toons will be deleted permanently.The Goon Squad easily dominate the first half of the game, using their powers to score extra points. During the break, Sylvester attempts to recruit former Tune Squad member Michael Jordan, but accidentally locates Michael B. Jordan instead, mistaking him for his similar name. LeBron realises his mistake not to make them use his skills and allows Bugs to devise the strategy for the second half, using their loony cartoon physics to catch up with the Goon Squad. During a respite, however, LeBron confronts Dom and tells him he no longer wants to stand in the way of his dream.Al-G assumes control of the Goon Squad and uses his own abilities to make them seemingly unbeatable. Dom suddenly discovers the only way to win the game is to use the move he previously showed LeBron, even though he will be deleted. However, during the final seconds of the game, Bugs performs the move, sacrificing himself and enabling Dom to help LeBron score the final point, winning the game and ""posterising"" Al-G into a poster which is later destroyed by his assistant Pete, erasing him forever. The James family and the abducted citizens are returned to the real world, while in Tune World, Bugs bids farewell to his friends before he disappears.In the real world, LeBron comes to see his family in a different light and supports Dom's decision to become a video game designer. After dropping him off at E3, he is approached by Bugs, who actually survived due to the fact that as a fictional cartoon-animated character, his abilities meaning that he cannot really ""die"". He asks LeBron to put him up for a little while until he can find a way back to Toon World. LeBron agrees, but Bugs goes on to ask if he can invite the rest of the Looney Toons over to LeBron's place as well.",comedy,"[[[230 140   0]

On a stormy night during World War II, a female pilot with top-secret cargo talks her way on board a bomber plane about to take off. The crass all-male crew reluctantly agrees, but their suspicions about her identity and the mysterious cargo quickly grow. Just then a shadow appears in the clouds. Was it the incoming Japanese fleet or was it caused by some other sinister stowaway? In the throes of World War II, Captain Maude Garrett joins the all-male crew of a B-17 bomber with a top-secret package. Caught off-guard by the presence of a woman on a military flight, the crew tests Maude's every move. Just as her quick wit is winning them over, strange happenings and holes in her backstory incite paranoia surrounding her true mission. But this crew has more to fear: lurking in the shadows, something sinister is tearing at the heart of the plane. Trapped between an oncoming air ambush and an evil lurking within, Maude must push beyond her limits to save the hapless crew and protect her mysterious cargo. In August 1943, Pilot Officer Maude Garrett, a female flight officer, is assigned to travel with a top secret package from Auckland, New Zealand, to Samoa. When she arrives at the airbase, she sees a ground crew ramp worker disappear before her eyes-just before suddenly finding herself standing right in front of her transport, a B-17 bomber called The Fool's Errand. The bomber's crew gives her a mostly derisive welcome and she is quartered in the Sperry Ball turret for the takeoff. With no room left for her document valise, she reluctantly allows the only crew member friendly to her, Staff Sergeant Walter Quaid, to store it.While stuck in the turret, Maude sees some sort of creature clinging to the underside of the bomber's wing. She reports it, but most of the crew-except Private Beckell, who sees it too-dismisses her. When she is allowed to leave the turret, the hatch malfunctions, trapping her inside. When she reacts indignantly to the crew's comments about her situation, they abandon their attempts to open the hatch and the comm is cut off. After seeing a Japanese fighter appearing and disappearing close to the bomber, she is abruptly attacked by the creature, a gremlin; she fights it off but ends up injured. When the crew contacts her again to ask what happened, a radio message comes in telling them that a Maude Garrett doesn't exist and is not registered for the flight. ",action,"[[[ 64 141  97]

He dreams of a career in jazz, to which his seamstress mother, Libba, objects. By chance, his former student Curly informs him of an opening in the band of jazz legend Dorothea Williams. Joe impresses Dorothea with his piano playing and is offered the job on the spot. As Joe happily heads off to prepare for his first performance later that night, he falls down a manhole.Joe finds himself as a soul heading into the ""Great Beyond"". Unwilling to die before his big break, he tries to escape but ends up in the ""Great Before"", where soul counselors-all named Jerry-prepare unborn souls for life on Earth. Joe poses as an instructor who is set to train the souls and is assigned 22, a cynical soul who has remained in the Great Before for millennium and sees no point in living on Earth. 22 reveals that she has a badge that fills up with traits. She needs to find her ""spark"" to complete it and says she will give it to Joe so that he can return home.Joe tries to assist 22 in finding a passion, but the attempts prove futile. With no other options, 22 takes him out to ""the zone"", an area that people enter when their passion sets them into a euphoric trance; it also houses the lost souls who become obsessed. They meet Moonwind, a sign twirler who enters the zone to rescue lost souls. He agrees to help Joe return to his body and they learn that Joe\'s fall down the manhole sent him into a coma. Joe excitedly hops back to Earth but accidentally brings 22 with him, resulting in 22 entering his body and Joe ending up in the body of a therapy cat. Meanwhile, Terry, an accountant designated to counting souls headed to the Great Beyond, finds the count off and convinces the Jerrys to let her return the missing soul.22 and Joe escape the hospital.

They head to Joe's apartment where Connie, one of Joe's students, arrives to tell him that she is quitting the band. Before leaving, Connie plays a passionate trombone solo, stunning 22, who convinces her of the talent she has and that music is for her. Happy, Connie thanks ""Joe"" and leaves, having changed her mind. They next go to get a haircut where 22 holds a deep, poignant conversation with Dez, the barber. After 22 rips Joe's pants while bending down, the duo go to see Libba to have it fixed; after ""Joe"" reconciles with his mother, Libba finally accepts Joe's passion for music and offers him his late father's old suit.Before Moonwind can restore Joe, 22, who both experiences an epiphany and decides she must find her purpose on Earth, refuses to proceed with Joe's restoration. As she flees with Joe tailing behind, Terry catches up and brings both back to the Great Before, where 22 sees that her badge has been filled out. However, Joe tells her that his experiences and tastes earned the badge. Angry, 22 tosses the badge at Joe and disappears into the zone. Joe learns from a Jerry that instead of a life's purpose, a spark simply means that a soul is ready to live. He heads back to Earth and has a successful first performance with the Dorothea quartet, but does not feel right about what happened.Inspired by the objects 22 collected while in his body, Joe plays the piano to enter the zone and look for 22, who is now a lost soul.

Using a small maple seed that 22 had collected, Joe convinces her that she is ready to live, and she returns to normal.

And like a war dog picking up the enemy's scent, brutal Amleth embarks on a murderous quest to find the hateful adversary, whose life is forever woven together with his by the threads of fate. Now, in the name of Valhalla, no one can stop the Northman, not even God. In AD , King Aurvandill returns to the island of Hrafnsey after his overseas conquests, reuniting with his wife, Queen Gudrn, and his heir, Prince Amleth. To prepare Amleth for his eventual ascension, the two participate in a spiritual ceremony overseen by Aurvandill's jester, Heimir. The next morning, Aurvandill's bastard brother Fjlnir murders the king, raids his hillfort and carries away Gudrn. Amleth flees by boat swearing vengeance.Years later, Amleth lives as a berserker with a band of Vikings. After an attack in Gardariki, Amleth encounters a Seeress in the temple of Svetovit; the Seeress predicts that Amleth will soon take revenge on Fjlnir, and that his path is intertwined with a MaidenKing. Amleth learns that Fjlnir was overthrown by Harald of Norway and lives in exile in Iceland. Posing as a slave, Amleth sneaks aboard a ship. He encounters a Slavic woman named Olga, who claims to be a sorceress. They are taken to Fjlnir's farm, where he learns his mother has married and bore a son named Gunnar with Fjlnir.One night, Amleth encounters a Hewitch, who facilitates a spiritual dialogue between Amleth and the late Heimir, revealed to have been murdered by Fjlnir. He then tells Amleth about Draugr, a magical sword at the Gates of Hel. Amleth enters a mound and obtains the blade after fighting the undead Mound Dweller. The next day, Amleth is selected to compete in a game of knattleikr against another farm. The game turns violent and Gunnar is almost killed, but Amleth saves him. As a reward, Fjlnir's adult son, Thorir, grants him overseer duties and allows him to choose a woman.",action,"[[[27 33 45]

Surviving a zombie apocalypse beats being a wage slave any day. After spending years slaving away for a soul-crushing company, Akira's life has lost its luster. He lives in a trash-filled apartment, his pay is abysmal, and he can't even muster up the nerve to confess his love to his beautiful co-worker. But when a zombie apocalypse ravages his town, it gives him the push he needs to live for himself. Now Akira's on a mission to complete all 100 items on his bucket list before he...well, kicks the bucket. Akira Tendo (Eiji Akaso), a 24-year-old office worker of ZLM, discovers himself trapped in a routine and meaningless life. Akira works for Gonzou Kosugi (Kazuki Kitamura). Kosugi makes Akira work very late nights from his first day on the job. The workplace is toxic as hell. Akira has to pull in several all night shifts in a row just to keep up with the work.Akira has a crush on co-worker Ohtori.He lacks drive and motivation since he is disenchanted with his career; however, when a zombie apocalypse caused by experimental bio weaponry unexpectedly strikes Tokyo, everything is turned upside down. Instead of succumbing to dread, Akira sees this as an opportunity to experience life to the fullest rather than settle for his humdrum existence. Akira texts Ohtori and gets a response. Akira goes to meet her at her apartment, avoiding zombies along the way. Akira finds that the director of their firm is in Ohtori's apartment and has turned into a Zombie. Together, Akira and Ohtori kill the Zombie. But then Ohtori also changes into a zombie, as she had been bitten. Akira returns to his apartment and feels all alone in the world.He decides to create a bucket list of everything he wants to do before dying in order to not only experience it firsthand but also to show that he is still alive and well. This decision is made with a newfound sense of purpose. Akira starts by cleaning his apartment. He shops at the supermarket, without caring about the price. Dyes his hair. Paints a self-portrait. Rides a motorcycle. Sets off fireworks and so on.Akira calls his friend Kencho and finds out that Kencho is alive. Akira meets Shizuka Mikazuki (Mai Shiraishi) in a supermarket and learns that Zombies are attracted to sound. Akira goes to rescue Kencho from a love hotel in full American football gear to avoid being bitten by zombies. Kencho is happy to be rescued by Akira and both share a hearty meal together. Kencho sees Akira's list.One of Akira's wishes is to be a superhero who saves everyone. Akira decides to steal a shark suit from an aquarium. The suit is designed to withstand shark bites and Akira reckons it should be enough to save them from Zombies.With the happy company of his friend, Kencho (Shuntaro Yanagi), Akira embarks on a number of exciting and frequently bizarre excursions throughout the zombie-infested city. Their pranks range from simple pleasures like eating at expensive restaurants for free to more extravagant pursuits like going on roller coasters and visiting haunted houses.Akira and Kencho come across other survivors who have their own motivations for surviving as they make their way through the dangerous streets swarming with flesh-eating zombies. Turns out the aquarium is also the location for safe house nearest to Tokyo and the survivors are headed to it, including Shizuka.Shizuka is not in favor of Akira's style of doing stupid things and taking unnecessary risks. But when Shizuka is cornered by zombies, Kencho and Akira team up to save her. They take possession of a camper to travel to the aquarium. Shizuka is still cold towards Akira.The guys take Shizuka for Yoga on a lake with paddle-boards, parasailing, campfire and they reach a hot spring. Kencho knows that Akira has feelings for Shizuka. Shizuka thanks Akira for helping her out. Eventually the trio reach the aquarium the following day, which is day 10 of the apocalypse. Akira finds Kosugi is in charge.

Kosugi turned the aquarium into a shelter and a safe house.Kosugi shows how he runs a tight operation at the aquarium to keep everybody safe and fed. Is anyone objects, they are kicked out.

Kosugi feasts like a King, while the rest are served scraps of food as their daily rations.But one worker makes a mistake, while outside collecting supplies. A zombie gets on the truck without him knowing and makes its way to the aquarium. The aquarium is soon attacked by zombies and overwhelmed. Kencho was already planning to escape with Shizuka and asks Akira to come. Akira decides to stay at the Aquarium. Shizuka finds Akira's list inside the camper and decides to fight for him. She confronts Akira in front of Kosugi and says that if Akira stays, he is no better than zombies. Kosugi didn't know that Zombies had taken over part of the aquarium. Kosugi insults Akira by taking his list from Shizuka and stomping on it. Akira quits his job with Kosugi, just as the facility is overtaken by zombies. Kosugi saves himself, while Akira tries to save everyone he can.Meanwhile zombies have bitten a great white shark in the aquarium, and it has also turned into a zombie and has grown legs.

Drea is at the peak of her high school powers when her entire life goes up in flames after her sex tape gets leaked to the whole school, seemingly by her boyfriend and king of the school, Max. Eleanor is an awkward new transfer student who is angered to find out that she now has to go to school with her old bully, Carissa who started a nasty rumor about her in summer camp when they were 13. After a clandestine run-in at tennis camp, Drea and Eleanor form an unlikely and secret friendship to get revenge on each other's tormentors. Drea has the perfect boyfriend - Rosehill's golden boy, and is even besties with the elite groups of the school. She is also an A-grade student, which makes her worthy of the perfect future with a scholarship at Yale followed by a secured life as a Howard law graduate. However, her efforts of 17 years of meticulously planning her life go for a toss when her boyfriend leaks her topless video.At the same time, Eleanor, a shy girl with past trauma of her own, joins the Tennis club where Drea is spending her behavioral-probation time. After learning about each other's trauma-stricken experiences, both plan for a sinister revenge game that changes everything in the coming season of school time. The devastating experience in school makes Drea understand that being vulnerable in front of people will not do her any good. She learns her lesson the hard way and as her headmaster advises her; tries to process her anger in a better way than punching the school's golden boy. We are also introduced to the second lead of the film - Eleanor. While overspeeding her car showing her rebellious personality, she talks to her mother over the call, who is delighted about her daughter's decision to join the tennis club. Although her mother pushes her to make new friends at the club, Eleanor is happy just being friends with her pet lizard - Oscar Winner Olivia Colman.Sun basking and reading Patricia Highsmith's Strangers on a Train (the screenplay of the film is inspired by the book's film adaptation by Hitchcock) on the side field of a tennis court, Eleanor notices Drea impairing the new joiner's determination to play. The uncrushed spirit of Drea makes Eleanor instantly realize they will be best friends one day. I think teenage girls are eviler than adolescent boys. They wouldn't even think twice about hurting people back if someone hurt them. The film at this point makes sure we know this and learn from it. Eleanor understands how to get Drea's attention; hence, she tells her that Erica showed everyone the leaked video. And just like how the stars would have it, Erica's life is upside down when she is arrested for possessing drugs.While bidding goodbye to Erica for rehab, Drea makes sure everyone knows what she can do if someone dares to demean her. Later, when her car gets broken, Eleanor offers her a lift. And even though she is initially reluctant to engage with her, she agrees to tag along. We then learn that Eleanor was defamed for being a predator to young girls after she tried to come out to a girl she liked in her school.Bonding after learning about each other's past and realizing they have nothing else to lose - the girls become good friends. In the meantime, school reopens, resuming the extravagant life of the Rosehill students.On one side, Eleanor meets Gabi, who introduces her to nincompoops and elite groups of people from a distance. At the same time, Drea's return surprises her best friend, Tara - who forgot about her after the scandalous event. Max, on the other hand, continues to be a prick to Drea as he embarrasses her in front of the whole school by publicly apologizing for the misfortune she had to go through.Even though Drea had been putting on a lovely faÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â§ade of keeping her chin up the whole time, when Max tried to break her esteem like that, she finally breaks down. To avoid people's hollowness and terrible sympathies, Drea corners herself in the school washroom, which is her favorite spot. Eleanor follows her and tries to express that she is there for her. However, Drea just wouldn't let anyone take undue advantage of her feelings.When Eleanor shares her brief encounter with the girl who ruined her preteen life, Drea understands that both of them are going through somewhat similar turmoil. Because they have to endure the ordeal of all the shame, unwanted guilt, and pity of all these people who don't value them for their truer selves, they start manifesting verbal desire to hurt them. Drea's mastermind soon picks up a hint from her conversation with Eleanor, and both devise a cunning plan to bring the people down who caused them immense pain and cost them their happiness. Since nobody knows they know each other, Drea proposes Eleonor pretend to play someone very hard to please in order to earn Max's attention. Once he is in her loop, she will automatically get introduced to the group that was once close-knit with Drea. And even though Eleanor's inner closeted personality doesn't allow her to be someone like that, she gives in - because, in return, she gets to take down the girl who defamed her as a kid.Knowing that both of them share an almost Glenn Close in Fatal Attraction energy, or in their term Glenergy, the girls move on with the second & third step to their master plan - a makeover followed by trapping the first rat - Max.Once Eleanor gets Max following her everywhere, she starts behaving the way Drea taught her to - considering the latter knows what intrigues her ex-boyfriend in a girl. When Max invites Eleanor to his annual summer party at his beach house, the girls carefully prep for the next course of action. Drea wants Eleanor to spy on Max while he is busy partying so they can collect evidence on him being the scoundrel that he is in reality.Drea takes an interest in the gardening program that Carissa is running and soon learns that she is not just growing vegetables in the greenhouse. She tries to closely follow Carissa's moves, in order to learn more about her. While Eleanor is assisting Drea in executing her master plan, the latter has already plotted a revenge strategy for her new friend.While half the school is partying at Max's house, the other group is relaxing at the beach. At this point, Drea is attracted to Carissa's best friend, Rush, who entertains her with genuine love and feelings. Eleanor, on the other hand, finds her way to Max's room and gets her hand on his phone. She looks it up and finds out that he has been cheating on his current girlfriend - Tara, with the internet witch. However, when she is about to take pictures of the chats he exchanged with the girl, Eleanor finds herself hiding from the possible make-out session between Max and Tara.Tara is a considerably sweet girl by heart, and being in a relationship with her ex-best friend's ex-lover keeps haunting her. Hence, she mentions this to Max, but he doesn't genuinely seem to be affected by this. Noticing her new boyfriend's coldness, she immediately rejects him and storms out of the room. Soon, Max notices that Eleanor is hiding in the room, and he asks her to join him at his favorite place in the house. During their conversation, Eleanor effortlessly gets Max to unmask himself and talk about real things he wants to do. Seeing her genuinely take notice of what he has to say, Max gets enchanted by her. The next day, Eleanor and Drea slide into Rosehill farm to get hold of their next plan - steal shrooms from Carissa's greenhouse and dose everyone at the dinner that the latter has been working on for months. So far, their plans have been coming along perfectly as post-dinner the students started to behave erratically. This alerts the school headmaster who also received an anonymous tip (from Drea) to detain Carissa for growing drugs on the school property.Later that night, when the girls triumph over their evil actions to pin down people who hurt them, Drea suggests looking up everything Max has been doing. When Eleanor hacks his phone, she finds collective data that indicates that he is a big-time liar and attention seeker. This upsets Drea, but she has learned to grow a tough exterior that she doesn't want her friend to see. Eleanor explains that being vulnerable is alright, and she can trust her and live through the experience of her emotions as they come at this moment. Consequently, Valentine's day is right around the corner, and the school's editorial team has spoken to Max and printed his version of everything that happened after the leaked video. He presented himself in such a way that the entire school now believes that he is, after all, an accidental feminist.On the other hand, while Drea's life is busier with her new form of love connection with Rush, she is soon summoned by the headmaster for her dropped academic performance. She learns this will jeopardize her entry to Yale as they are considering revoking her scholarship.At the same time, after a failed attempt to bury Max's image to the ground, Tara helps plot rumors all around the school that she and Max are in an open relationship. Although it has a crazier response from the entire school, it doesn't go well with Drea, who had imagined a better outcome to her plan. Witnessing how things drastically took turns against her plan, Drea is angrier than ever. She is fuming at how Max continues to win. Eleanor can see how the rage and hunger for pulling down Max have engulfed Drea's vision and their friendship. And even though she tries to explain it, Drea seems to only be concentrated on strategizing more evil plans. At this point, Eleanor mentions to Drea that it's her birthday the next day; however, Drea ignores it and wants her friend to help her in getting her revenge over anything else. Taking time off from Drea, Eleanor meets Gabi (Max's sister) and realizes they both have a strong connection. After learning Gabi understands and sees her through, Eleanor admits her fondness for her. Later, Max & Tara throw a surprise birthday bash at Eleanor's house that completely sweeps her off her feet. When Drea discovers this, she decides to crash the party with Rush. It makes things uncomfortable as Max and Tara wonder how these girls know one another.Eleanor takes Drea outside, and both get into a heated argument where Drea reminds her that these people will not take two seconds to throw her out if she revolts against them. Eleanor points out how selfish Drea has been all this while and ignores her, considering they have been dealing with everything together. In a spiff of anger, she also tells Drea that there isn't enough evidence for her to blame Max for leaking her video. Taken aback by what she heard, Drea leaves and Eleanor realizes that Gabi overheard everything. When she tries to explain, Gabi points out that this is not her real personality and the sooner she realizes the better it will be for her. Later that night, Drea discovers someone removed the spark plug of her car again. She soon realizes that Eleanor is behind all this and has been putting up with a fake story to be her friend all this time.To find out more, Drea meets Carissa at the rehabilitation center to get to the bottom of finding out about Eleanor. After speaking with her, she learns that only Drea teased and spread rumors about Eleanor as a kid. All this time, Eleanor had been framing her so she could take revenge against Drea for ruining her life. Eleanor also leaked Drea's topless video, and all this time, Drea was, after the wrong person and teamed up with a girl that the film now reintroduces as a psychopath.The film now shows both sides of the story. On one side, we know Drea got bamboozled. And at the same time, Eleanor declares that teenage girls are indeed psychopaths. She still thinks that Drea is the same person who would do anything to be on the top at all times. Eleanor is not guilty of leading her friend's life to hell. Are we sympathizing with the wrong girl here after learning Eleanor's story?In the next moment, we see the two friends-now foes coming face to face with one another. Eleanor (or Nora) explains that she has had the upper hand the entire time because narcissists (Drea, in this case) are too focused on themselves to realize they have been played. There seems no end to the game Nora continues to play with Drea.She wants Drea to go to the admissions party and push her friends to do the craziest thing they have ever done. Nora plans to leak all this information and pin it on Drea - finally getting her revenge. She also tells Drea that Rush knows everything and leaves.On her way to telling the truth, Drea meets with an accident. Eleanor visits Drea and explains that this accident will help her get back to her friends, who will give her a free pass to the admission party. Later, at the hospital, Rush pushes her to give up everything and come clean to the headmaster. However, the time is not suitable to give up.Then, the big day of the event finally arrives. Drea and Eleanor reach the party with plans of their own. While at the party, Drea starts bullying Eleanor in front of her friends. The two of them move out and discuss that they are both hurting from the bitterness. In a rage, Drea throws the secret camera that Eleanor had asked her to wear so as to record the wrong happenings at the party. However, she also confesses in front of Eleanor that she has had a change of heart and she no longer wants to be this person fighting over things that are in the past.While the girls confront one another with their feelings, Max overhears everything. He tries to blackmail them by threatening to show all the conversations that had with each other over destroying him to everyone at the party. At this point, the film clearly establishes that young boys are plain dumb and the perfect example of narcissists who won't absolve anything that hurts their weak male ego. Thanks, patriarchy!Once Max is through blabbering his agendas and gone, Eleanor shows Drea that she had been recording everything he had said using her backup camera attached to her crop top. Back at the party, while everyone is having a gala time and Max is in the other room, the music stops abruptly. When Max comes out to check what stopped the music, he finds everyone looking at the recordings of his conversation earlier with the girls.While he tries to explain himself with his continued lies, everyone immediately dismisses him. The girls win and return to their old friendship as everything comes to a full circle. ",comedy,"[[[255 225 197]

David and Georgia, two divorced parents who can't stand each other, head to Bali after their daughter, Lily, announces her plans to marry a local islander she just met while on holiday. They decide to put aside their differences and work together to stop the wedding, believing that doing so will keep Lily from making a dreadful mistake similar to their own.Ã‚Â—J. Brown. After an ill-starred five-year marriage, former college sweethearts David and Georgia divorced and have been dealing with loathing and resentment for the past 19 years. And as the bitter antagonists enjoy a carefree life away from each other, their daughter Lily, newly graduated from law school, drops a bombshell: she's getting married in four days to handsome Gede, eager to start afresh in Bali, Indonesia. As a result, simmering with restless irritation, Georgia and David agree to play along and devise a secret plan to sabotage the young couple's traditional Balinese wedding. However, there's something mysterious about exotic Bali. Can David and Georgia bury the hatchet for old times' sake?Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas"", 'David and Georgia Cotton are a formerly married couple who hate each other and regret their marriage, which ended 20 years earlier. Their daughter Lily graduates from law school, and goes on vacation to Bali with her friend and fellow graduate Wren. While snorkeling off the coast, their tour boat leaves them behind, and they are rescued by a young Balinese seaweed farmer named Gede. Lily and Gede hit it off. 37 days later, Lily emails David and Georgia to let them know that she and Gede are getting married, and she is staying in Bali permanently, giving up her legal career before it begins. David and Georgia form a truce to try and convince Lily that she is rushing into things and making the same mistake that they had made. Their pilot on the flight to Bali turns out to be Paul, Georgia's boyfriend, who arranged to fly this flight and return to visit Georgia in Bali a few days later, as a surprise.David and Georgia give their verbal blessing to Lily and Gede, but secretly plan a ""Trojan horse"" strategy to sabotage the wedding from within. Their scheme includes stealing the couple's wedding rings, which the couple quickly replaces. Gede immediately suspects David and Georgia, but hides his suspicions from Lily. While carrying out this plan, David and Georgia begin to mend fences with one another. They also get to know Gede and his large extended family and come to see that he really does care for Lily. Paul shows up and surprises Georgia with a series of marriage proposals, the first of which is interrupted by a snake bite at the temple of Tanah Lot, and the second proposal is prevented by an accidental head-butt.When Lily discovers the stolen rings, she demands that they get on board with the wedding or go home. She also confronts Gede, who had simultaneously confessed his harbored suspicions toward David and Georgia stealing the rings. David and Georgia realize that they will lose Lily forever if they do not support her decision, and they decide to offer their support. The wedding proceeds in accordance with Balinese custom. As the couple prepares to ceremonially stab a dagger through a pandan-leaf mat to complete the bond of marriage, Gede pauses the wedding ceremony to ask David and Georgia to give their blessing sincerely this time, offering not to go through with it unless they agree. David stands up and says that the couple has their blessing, but that they do not really need it, and if he and Georgia had listened to all of their own detractors (David's friends and Georgia's parents, respectively), they never would have had Lily. And however their marriage turned out, they are both happier in a world with Lily in it. Lily and Gede are touched, and they complete the ceremony and get married.On the morning of the wedding, Georgia tells Paul that she cannot marry him, and they end their relationship. David and Georgia toy with romance again, even kissing each other once, before pulling away and laughing about it. David, Georgia, and Wren exchange tearful goodbyes with Lily and board a boat to leave. David and Georgia consider their romantic prospects again, debating aloud whether they are too old to feel young again, and when they might return to Bali.

In Marvel Studios ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Marvel Studios. With everyone around him dead and Gamora's tragic demise in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) etched on his mind, a broken Peter Quill drowns his sorrows in Knowhere, the Guardians' headquarters. But life and time wait for no one. And as a devastating blow comes out of nowhere, leaving a dear friend incapacitated, the depressed Star-Lord must pull himself together to assemble his crew for one last life-and-death mission. This time, however, it seems the space defenders have bitten off more than they can chew. They say the third time's the charm. But with the dark past catching up with them, can the Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) thwart the sinister plans of an unstoppable intergalactic megalomaniac? Can they save the universe one more time?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas. Due to losing his beloved Gamora during the events of Infinity War, Peter Quill is in a dismal state of depression. But now, Peter must rally the Guardians of the Galaxy to come back together once more when Rocket's past comes back to haunt him. Along with aid from the Ravagers and a duplicate Gamora (who doesn't remember her last life with the team), the Guardians travel to a world that is similar to Earth full of anthropomorphic animal experimentations that is ruled by the malicious High Evolutionary who seeks to make the universe better in his image. Now it will take all the wit and charm and strength of the Guardians to fight the High Evolutionary's plans and save the universe one final time. Peter is still depressed over losing Gamora at the hands of Thanos back in Infinity War and 2014 Gamora has no memory of her future relationship with Peter. But things become worse for the Guardians of the Galaxy, when Rocket is severely injured by Adam Warlock, son of the disgraced high priestess Ayesha. In order to save Rocket from dying, the Guardians decide to infiltrate Orgo Corp with the help from 2014 Gamora, who has joined the United Ravagers. The Guardians soon learn that the High Evolutionary is responsible for experimenting on Rocket many years ago on Counter Earth, but horrific truths will soon come into light for the heroes including the High Evolutionary's desperation to capture Rocket for his illegal experiments. As a baby raccoon, Rocket is a test subject for the High Evolutionary in order to create a Counter-Earth populated by anthropomorphic animals. He becomes friends with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor, three of the High Evolutionary's other test subjects. Rocket displays intelligence and aptitude beyond the other animals and deduces the flaw in the anthropomorphization process, angering the High Evolutionary. They later learn that they will not be part of the new Earth after the High Evolutionary perfects the formula to anthropomorphize. When the High Evolutionary suspects an escape attempt, he kills Lylla, Teefs and Floor, enraging Rocket, who mauls him and escapes.Years later, the Guardians of the Galaxy have established their headquarters on a rebuilt Knowhere. The night after settling in, they are attacked by Adam Warlock, a super-powered being created out of revenge by his ""mother"" the empress of the Sovereign, Ayesha, for previously stealing from her people. They are ordered to bring Rocket to the High Evolutionary, who has become obsessed with retrieving his subject for the purpose of isolating and replicating Rocket's intellect. During the fight, Rocket is seriously injured, leaving the Guardians unable to tend to his wounds due to a killswitch embedded in him. The team resolve to travel to the Orgoscope, headquarters of the High Evolutionary's company Orgocorp, in the hopes of finding an override code.With the assistance of the Ravagers and a reluctant 2014-Gamora, the Guardians infiltrate Orgosphere and retrieve Rocket's file. However, they are attacked by Orgosphere's guards, barely escaping after Peter Quill remotely activates the guards\' suit jet-packs. They deduce that Theel, one of the High Evolutionary\'s scientists, may have the override code stored in his memory, and decide to track him down. The team visits Counter-Earth against Gamora's advice, followed by Ayesha and Adam. With help from a family of bat-like humanoids, Quill, Nebula and Groot trace Theel to the High Evolutionary's ship, while Drax and Mantis remain with Gamora and Rocket. Quill and Groot board the High Evolutionary's ship, leaving Nebula behind. Mantis unwillingly accompanies Drax to the High Evolutionary's ship, which begins to launch with Quill and Groot captured on-board, a process that also destroys Counter-Earth.Gamora stays with Rocket, but is attacked by a pig warrior sent by the High Evolutionary, who, herself, is killed when Warlock arrives looking for Rocket. Gamora overpowers Adam and launches the Guardians' ship. Quill and Groot successfully defeat the High Evolutionary's forces and kill Theel, jumping off with him and retrieving his memory before Gamora meets them. Meanwhile, believing Quill and Groot are still on-board, Nebula, Mantis, and Drax board the High Evolutionary's ship to rescue them, and a weakened Adam senses that his mother is in danger but is too late to save her. On the Guardians' ship, Rocket flat-lines and has a near death experience, where he is met by Lylla, Teefs and Floor, who tell him that his time has not yet come before Quill successfully implements the override code and revives him.Mantis, Nebula, and Drax come across hordes of imprisoned children on the High Evolutionary's ship before being captured themselves, and placed in a chamber with Abilisks. Mantis is able to persuade the Abilisks to side with them, and the three escape the chamber before reuniting with the Guardians and overpowering the High Evolutionary's army. Kraglin and Cosmo arrive in Knowhere, which Cosmo connects to the High Evolutionary's ship with the help of Nebula and Kraglin, through her powers of telekinesis allowing them to free the captured children.Rocket discovers a litter of baby raccoons and other test subject animals, but is attacked by a deranged High Evolutionary while attempting to free them before being rescued by the Guardians. The High Evolutionary is left to perish on his ship while the animals are rescued and board Knowhere along with most of the Guardians. After Cosmo is unable to hold the ships together for long enough for him to board, Quill barely escapes, beginning to freeze in space before being rescued by Adam.The Guardians decide to disband. Quill bestows the rank of Captain of the Guardians upon Rocket before leaving for Earth. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks. Gamora reunites with the Ravagers, Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children.In a mid-credits scene: Captain Rocket is seen leading the new Guardians of the Galaxy, composed of a fully-grown Groot, Adam, Cosmo, Phyla-Vell, Kraglin and Blurp as they prepare a new mission.In a post-credits scene: Quill reconnects with his grandfather.",comedy,"[[[254 255 255]

There's just one tantalising dream for the women of Ballygar to taste freedom and escape the gauntlet of domestic life: to win a pilgrimage to the sacred French town of Lourdes. And with a little benevolent interference from their cheeky and rebellious priest, close friends Lily, Eileen, Dolly and Sheila are the 'lucky' few to win this ticket of a lifetime at their riotous local raffle night.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—TMDB"", ""Lourdes, a picturesque country town at the base of the magnificent French Pyrenees, and a place of miracles, is a magnet for 6 million visitors each year from across the globe. Ballyfermot, Ireland, 1960: A hilariously hard-knocks community in outer Dublin that marches to its own beat - frenzied, fast and loose - and yet also deeply soulful; rooted in traditions of loyalty, faith and togetherness. It's a thriving community in a constant uphill battle to live as fully as possible, on very little. And the opportunity to rise above one's daily struggles is frankly a pipe dream, especially for women. There's just one tantalising dream for the women of Ballyfermot to taste freedom and escape the gauntlet of domestic life: to win a pilgrimage to the sacred French town of Lourdes, and all for free. And with a little benevolent interference from their cheeky and rebellious priest, close friends LILY, EILEEN, DOLLY and SHEILA are the 'lucky' few to win this ticket of a lifetime at their riotous local raffle night.Having never even left Dublin - let alone Ireland - the journey provides our heroines the chance to let their hair down, celebrate life and delight in some sweet independence. But it's not all just a 'jolly': the women have a very important role to play when they arrive in Lourdes - to act as 'pushers' for the seriously ill and disabled pilgrims, there to bathe in the town's healing springs. And it's also a chance to reflect on their own lives, with each of the women in search of their own personal miracles. But when they are joined by CHRISSIE, recently returned from a decades-long exile in the USA, deep wounds from the past are re-opened, and bitter truths exposed. As they confront one another and embrace their past, these women realise that the miracle they have all been looking for is right in front of them: in the strength of their friendships and unshakeable togetherness. Truly joyous, uplifting, hilarious and aspirational - and an invitation to meet our heroines, all just as funny, messy, vocal and flawed as ourselves - THE MIRACLE CLUB empowers us all to communicate, love and laugh, and discover that we are only as strong as the friends and family who stand by us.",comedy,"[[[255 255 255]

381,tt6217926,"The film begins with an introduction by its director, Leos Carax, and its writers, Sparks, in a recording studio. They, along with the principal actors, walk through the streets of Los Angeles and welcome the audience to the story.

Henry McHenry (Adam Driver) is a stand-up comedian popular for being brazenly controversial and provocative. He tells a sold-out crowd about his new fiancÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©, Ann Desfranoux (Marion Cotillard), a famous opera singer. He says that he feels she has changed him, but doesn't know how yet. When prompted to say why he became a comedian, Henry says it was to disarm people, since making people laugh is the only way he can tell the truth without getting killed.

Later, he picks up Ann from the stage door of the opera, where they are hounded by reporters. Henry mockingly dances for them.

Ann and Henry sing about how much they love each other and how fast their romance has progressed- he has recently moved into her mansion, tucked away in the woods- and a showbiz news blurb tells us that they have gotten married.

At the opera, The Conductor (Simon Helberg) works not as a conductor but as Ann's piano accompanist. He tells the audience about his dreams of conducting orchestras around the world, and his secret love for Ann. Ann, meanwhile, is happy with Henry, but feels that she doesn't know him- she sings that she fears him, yet doesn't know why.

Ann and Henry soon have a baby girl, Annette. She appears to the audience as a wooden marionette puppet, but is treated by the other characters as a normal baby girl. Henry seems to be nervous and unsettled by the idea of fatherhood.

While being driven to the opera, Ann falls asleep and dreams that six women come forward publicly to accuse Henry of abusive violence, and that Henry himself crashes into her car on his motorcycle.

Henry returns to his tour in Las Vegas, and tells his audience that the morning of the show, he had killed his wife. The crowd is shocked and confused as he goes on to say that he tickled her to death in bed, before attempting to kill himself the same way. He seems extremely unstable and is booed off the stage. After seething backstage a moment, he rushes back onstage to scream at the audience, who scream right back. He realizes he's made a huge mistake- and the remainder of his tour is canceled as his career begins to nosedive. Ann's continues to flourish, though she still feels something is wrong and growing worse in her marriage.

In a possible attempt to grow closer, Ann and Henry take Annette on a yacht trip that goes awry when they are hit with a massive storm. Ann soothes Annette below deck and finds Henry outside, drunk, in the middle of the storm. She tells him repeatedly to come inside, but he grabs her and insists on waltzing in the storm. Their struggle becomes more serious as Henry airs his frustrations over Ann's success and his own failings. As they fight, he appears to push Ann over the side of the boat, which kills her instantly.

Henry rows Annette to shore in a lifeboat and waits for help. As they wait, the full moon begins to shine on Annette's face and she begins to sing a beautiful aria. Henry believes he must be imagining it and goes to sleep. We see the ghost of Ann, dripping wet, tell him that she will haunt him forever through Annette's voice.

Later, the police question Henry about Ann's disappearance but quickly conclude it was an act of God, and there was nothing Henry could have done to save her. On the way home, Henry buys Annette a spinning lamp for her bedroom that projects stars across the ceiling. When he turns it on for her, she begins to sing again, and he realizes he was not imagining her strange gift.

Meanwhile, the Conductor has finally become a conductor, and leads a rehearsal as he tells us his suspicions about Ann's death. He reveals they had had a brief affair the week before she met Henry, and that his love for her has never died. Henry invites him over to discuss Annette, and he feels obligated to attend despite his mistrust of him.

Henry shows the Conductor Annette's gift, and proposes they take her on a global tour to sing for the world. The Conductor insists such a show would be exploiting Annette, but Henry brushes him off. Reluctantly, the Conductor agrees.

Annette's ""miracle"" immediately becomes a worldwide sensation as they tour internationally. Henry seems to revel in the money and attention she has gotten back for him. The Conductor starts to take on much of Annette's care, as Henry goes out to party in the various cities they visit.

Back in L.A., Henry returns home drunk to find that Annette is singing the love song he and Ann used to sing together. He turns on the Conductor, insisting he had no right to teach it to her. The Conductor says that he had written the song for Ann first, and in fact believes he could be Annette's father. Enraged, Henry attacks him and drowns him in the swimming pool, unaware that Annette is still awake.

Henry decides to retire Annette from singing, but not before one final performance at the Hyper Bowl Halftime Show. Annette is flown into the stadium and introduced with much fanfare, but freezes up and will not sing. Henry watches as the music starts over several times but Annette remains silent. Finally, she says, ""Daddy kills people.""

Time passes, and is Henry arrested for both murders and completely reviled by the public. At his trial, he refuses to go under oath because he says he will be killed if he tells the truth. He begins to hear Ann's voice and sees her above him, looking as she did when she was alive- they sing together about how Henry would change his actions if he could go back. She disappears and is replaced by the dripping wet ghost of Ann that has been following Henry; she tells him that she is the one who will be keeping him company in jail.

Annette visits Henry in prison some time later. She sits in front of him, and as they begin to talk, he finally sees her not as a puppet but as a real little girl (Devyn McDowell). Henry attempts to explain himself, but Annette says that she doesn't think she can ever forgive him. She says he now has nothing to love, not even her. She is removed from the visiting room by the guard, Henry watching her leave through the window. He turns briefly to the camera and tells the audience to stop watching him. The puppet lies lifelessly on the floor.",romance,"[[[255 255 251]

In an underworld of weapons dealers and traffickers, a young boy becomes the pawn in a war between notorious drug lords. Trapped by kidnappers inside one of the world's most impenetrable cities, his rescue beckons the unparalleled skill of a mercenary named Tyler Rake, but Rake is a broken man with nothing to lose, harboring a death wish that makes an already deadly mission near impossible. Tyler Rake is a fearless black market mercenary with nothing left to lose when his skills are solicited to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord, but, in the murky underworld of weapons dealers and drug traffickers, an already deadly mission approaches the impossible, forever altering the lives of Rake and the boy. After a day at school, Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) - son of an incarcerated Indian drug lord - sneaks out of his house to visit a club, where he is kidnapped by police officers working for rival drug lord Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli). Saju Rav (Randeep Hooda), a former Para (SF) operator and Ovi's protector, visits Ovi's father in prison. Unwilling to pay the ransom as it will hurt his prestige, Ovi Mahajan Sr. (Pankaj Tripathi) orders Saju to retrieve his son, threatening Saju's own family.Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black-market mercenary and former SASR operator, is recruited by fellow mercenary Nik Khan (Golshifteh Farahani) to rescue Ovi from Dhaka, Bangladesh. Rake and Khan's team prepare to extract Ovi, with his father's men set to pay them once Ovi is recovered. Rake rescues Ovi, kills his captors, and takes him to the extraction point, but his father's men intentionally fail to transfer the funds. Instead, Saju kills Rake's teammates to bring Ovi back himself to avoid any payment to the mercenary group. Learning of Ovi's escape, Asif orders an immediate lockdown of Dhaka, securing all bridges out of the city.Khan arranges for a helicopter to extract Rake outside the city and tells him to abandon Ovi as they will not get paid for Ovi's extraction contract. He refuses, haunted by memories of his own son, who died at a young age from lymphoma when he left. After escaping Saju and the corrupt police and tactical units, Rake fights off a gang of boys led by Farhad, a young criminal determined to impress Asif. Rake calls his friend Gaspar (David Harbour), a retired squad-mate living in Dhaka, and he and Ovi lay low at Gaspar's home.",action,"[[[ 12  12  14]

Forced ashore, the men deteriorate in body and mind until a dark truth emerges that compels them to ally or perish. TV host Ray Marsh Michael Weaver and his directorproducer Alan Meursault Tim Griffin get their trip to Norway off on a bad start from the beginning when they arrive at a small Norwegian airport with no transportation arranged to take them to the boat where they need to be. They get lucky and find a ride through a local that Ray chats up outside, but this proves to be perhaps the last plot development that breaks their way.Just before boarding, the two manage to link up with their cameraman Sean Tibbets Justin Huen, a local they find on eerily short notice to come shoot the series for them. Something about Sean seems a little bit off, and those suspicions are confirmed when Ray opens a lunchbox that their third wheel carts around ... only to find a sound system and a set of headphones. They each take a listen, Ray for a bit longer, to hear the odd whale sounds emitted by the device.Sean does his job well enough on board, capturing footage of the charismatic captain Jim Rune Temte as well as the various contingents of Swedish tourists, Germans, and Norwegian scientists on board. Alan chats up the latter and learns they are on board to study the region's auroras. As they explain, these are powerful geostorms with the hypothetical power to disable electronic technology  perhaps even the human brain.Not long after the passengers witness a large seal with some conspicuous open wounds brutally mauling a younger animal of its own kind on an ice flow, Sean begins to notice a few other things off on the deck. A man seems to be bleeding out of his ear, and a flock of birds begins to circle ominously.",horror,"[[[254 254 252]

Amid chaos, and an impending Armageddon, the former Green Beret First Sergeant, biology teacher, and doting fatherofone Dan Forester, finds himself in the ruins of an alieninfested, perilladen urban maze, struggling for survival and answers along with a doomed army of untried soldiers. Now, a handful of defenders carries the weight of the world's desperate hopes. In December , biology teacher and former Green Beret, Dan Forester, fails to get a job at a prestigious research center. While he is watching the World Cup at a Christmas party, soldiers from the year  arrive to warn that humanity is on the brink of extinction due to a war with alien invaders the Whitespikes. The Whitespikes will arrive in November  and kill the majority of humanity three years later. In response, members of the world's militaries are sent into the future through a wormhole device called the Jumplink, but fewer than  survive deployment to return in seven days, prompting a worldwide draft.After a year of the draft and a growing antiwar movement, there is little hope for humanity's survival. Dan receives a notice that he has been drafted and reports with other draftees to basic training. Dan deduces with fellow draftee Charlie that in order to prevent a paradox, those drafted have already died before the war starts. The draftees are sent forward in time to a battlefield in Miami Beach but few survive, having been dropped in the incorrect location above the city. The draftees are ordered by Colonel Forester to rescue nearby lab personnel before the area is sterilized. The draftees discover the lab personnel dead but recover their research.

Based on the true story of France's last trial by combat in the Middle Ages. Knight Jean de Carrouges challenges his former friend Jacques Le Gris to a duel after Jean's wife Marguerite accuses Le Gris of rape. Told in multiple ""Rashomon-style"" points of view. In medieval France, Jean de Carrouges, a knight, challenges his friend, Squire Jacques Le Gris, to a lawful duel after Jean's wife, Marguerite, accuses Jacques of raping her. The movie shows the events leading up to the duel from three different truth versions. The truth according to Jean, the truth according to Jacques and the truth according to Lady Marguerite. 14th-century France. After saving his life in the Battle of Poitiers, Sir Jean de Carrouges, a veteran knight, falls out with his brother-in-arms and former friend, Squire Jacques Le Gris. Then, as Jean gradually loses favour with Count Pierre d'AlenÃ§on, Marguerite de Thibouville, Carrouges' beautiful wife, accuses Le Gris of raping her. And to defend her honour, Jean requests a duel, an outlawed custom. However, the truth is in the eye of the beholder. As a result, the interpretation of three distinct realities and three conflicting points of view culminates in a gruelling death match. But who will win the last duel?, ""Chapter One: The truth according to Jean de Carrouges. After serving in the Caroline War, Jean de Carrouges and his friend, squire Jacques Le Gris swear fealty to Count Pierre d'AlenÃ§on, who has been named Jean's overlord by his cousin, King Charles VI. Jacques later informs Jean that Pierre has ordered his new vassals to pay war levies, agreeing to ask for leniency on Jean's behalf when de Carrouges explains he lacks the funds. To restore his finances, Jean marries Marguerite de Thibouville, receiving a large dowry and the rights to many valuable estates. Pierre, however, has already gifted one piece of land to Jacques. When Jean sues for the land to be given to him, King Charles dismisses the suit. Pierre retaliates by appointing Jacques to the captaincy of a fort that Jean's family had held for generations. A military campaign in Scotland leaves Jean knighted for bravery but bankrupt. When he comes home from a visit to Paris, Marguerite tells him that Jacques raped her while she was home alone. Knowing that Pierre protects Jacques, Jean resolves to challenge him to a duel to the death, a request which Charles VI grants.",action,"[[[ 10  29  36]

Aussie Icon Paul Hogan just wants the quiet life. He lives in Brentwood, California, happy in retirement, content doing the daily crossword and enjoying regular calls from Lucy, his delightful yearold granddaughter in Sydney. So, when his agent drops by to tell him he'll be receiving a knighthood for services to comedy, he is less than impressed by this imposition and much to his agents' chagrin, turns down the offer. Paul attempts to return to his tranquil life but Lucy calls; she has excitedly told kids at her new school that granddad has been offered a Knighthood. They laughed at her. What? Paul realises he needs to get the Knighthood to help her salvage her reputation. After much begging and pleading, his agent reluctantly agrees to call the Palace. The Knighthood is back on.

He's accused of racism when he questions the reality of Will Smith playing his son in Dundee . He gets caught brawling with an illmannered Dundee impersonator on Hollywood Boulevard. He has to step in for noshow John Travolta at a charity ""Grease"" duet with Olivia Newton John, which enrages the diehard ""Grease"" fans. He finds himself in a car with the world's most unexpected Uber Driver and running from the law, and that's just the beginning. The media are having a field day as the headlines write themselves.

Young Luca and his best friend, Alberto, summon up the courage to visit the picturesque fishing village of Portorosso. However, the boys share and hide a great secret: they are not ordinary children but harmless sea monsters who live underwater, eager to find out what lies above the sea's surface. Before long, adventure after adventure and experience after experience, the two wide-eyed explorers will discover the true meaning of freedom, the importance of family, and the catalytic power of acceptance.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas. Set in a beautiful seaside town on the Italian Riviera, the original animated feature is a coming-of-age story about one young boy experiencing an unforgettable summer filled with gelato, pasta and endless scooter rides. Luca shares these adventures with his newfound best friend, but all the fun is threatened by a deeply-held secret: he is a sea monster from another world just below the water's surface. Luca Paguro is a pre-teen sea monster living off the coast of the Italian city of Portorosso who spends his days herding a school of fish. His parents, Daniela and Lorenzo, restrict him from going to the surface out of fear, but doing the same thing day after day ends up making Luca bored. One day, while feeling conflicted about whether or not to go to the surface, Luca meets another young sea monster named Alberto Scorfano. Alberto has been on land many times and has a hideout on an island near Portorosso where he claims he lives with his father. He begs Luca to follow him there. Reluctantly, Luca follows, and they transform into humans on the dry land and make their way to Alberto's hideout. Luca finds a poster in the hideout showing a Vespa, an Italian scooter, and they soon decide to make their own from scratch. All the while, Luca tries to keep his now double-life a secret from his parents with only his grandmother being clued in and keeping it a secret.Lorenzo and Daniela soon discover what Luca has been doing and decide that to keep Luca safe, he should be sent deeper into the ocean to live with Lorenzo's brother Ugo. Distraught, Luca runs away to the city of Portorosso with Alberto. There, they learn of the local bully and repeat champion of the Portorosso Cup Race, Ercole Visconti. Just as Ercole is about to dunk Luca's head into a fountain which would expose his identity as a sea monster, he is saved by a young girl named Giulia Marcovaldo. Giulia takes Luca and Alberto to her house where she lives for the summers with her one-handed father Massimo, an expert fish hunter seeking to kill a sea monster.Meanwhile, Daniela and Lorenzo are unable to find Luca anywhere, so they decide to go up to the surface to locate him. They begin splashing water on all of the boys there in an attempt to find Luca.Luca, Alberto and Giulia decide to enter the Portorosso Cup Triathlon together in hopes of winning money to buy a Vespa. The triathlon consists of three races: swimming laps, eating pasta, and riding a bike through the town. Each child decides to take up an individual task: Giulia takes up swimming, Alberto takes up eating pasta, and Luca takes up riding a bike after learning how. Over time, Ercole starts to become suspicious of the boys, and Luca and Giulia start to become closer to each other. When Giulia talks about going to school in another part of Italy where she spends the rest of the year, Luca develops an interest in it. Alberto becomes jealous of Luca and Giulia's growing friendship. After an argument, Alberto reveals his identity as a sea monster to Giulia. Luca does not do the same and instead acts afraid of Alberto, leaving Alberto to retreat to his hideout feeling betrayed.Back at Giulia's house, Giulia spills water on Luca, exposing him as a sea monster. Giulia sends him away, worrying that someone could hurt Luca if his true identity was discovered.Luca finds Alberto in his hideout sulking. After Luca questions Alberto about tally marks on the wall, Alberto reveals that he made the marks counting the days since his father left him there alone. Alberto is still mad at Luca and no longer wants to be a part of the triathlon, but Luca decides to enter with Giulia anyway.On the day of the triathlon, Luca and Giulia arrive without Alberto. After completing the first two challenges successfully, they enter the cycling stage. It begins to rain and Luca tries to avoid being turned back into a sea monster by stopping his bike under an awning. Alberto arrives at the scene with an umbrella to help Luca, but he gets wet and is transformed back into a sea monster. Ercole throws a net, trapping him. Risking his secret being exposed, Luca runs into the rain to save his friend. He frees Alberto but also gets transformed. Giulia tries to stop Ercole from hurting them but she ends up getting hurt herself. Luca and Alberto carry her back to town. When they get there, Ercole tries to kill Luca with a spear, but Luca puts the bully in his place. Everyone in the town of Portorosso sees that the sea monsters are not actually bad, especially Massimo, who thanks the boys for helping his daughter. Luca is reunited with his parents and they celebrate at Giulia's house.Later, Alberto reveals that he sold the Vespa they bought with the prize money to buy a train ticket for Luca to go to school with Giulia. Luca's family, Massimo, and Alberto (who has decided to stay in Portorosso) all see Luca and Giulia off at the train station.

409,tt7069210,"The Warrens investigate a murder that may be linked to a demonic possession. A chilling story of terror, murder and unknown evil that shocked even experienced real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. One of the most sensational cases from their files, it starts with a fight for the soul of a young boy, then takes them beyond anything they'd ever seen before, to mark the first time in U.S. history that a murder suspect would claim demonic possession as a defense. In 1981, only a few years after Michael Taylor's particularly violent Ossett Murder case that shocked the United Kingdom, and Janet Hodgson's blood-curdling Enfield Haunting case in The Conjuring 2 (2016), the experienced investigators of the unexplained, Ed Warren and Lorraine Warren, found themselves in Brookfield, Connecticut. There, Ed and Lorraine encountered something they'd never seen before: after the challenging exorcism of eight-year-old David Glatzel, Arne Johnson, a young friend of the Glatzels, began exhibiting increasingly strange behaviour. Then, more and more, the suffocating stranglehold of evil tightened around everyone involved, leading to murder and Johnson's incarceration. But, according to Arne, evil forces were at work. Did the devil, indeed, make him do it? Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren take on one of the most sensational cases of their careers after a cop stumbles upon a dazed and bloodied young man walking down the road. Accused of murder, the suspect claims demonic possession as his defense, forcing the Warrens into a supernatural inquiry unlike anything they've ever seen before. Ghost hunting couple Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) are enlisted to investigate a murder case, where a tenant (Ruairi O'Connor) has stabbed his landlord to death. The tenant defends that he was demonically possessed, as the Warrens journey to prove his defense and uncover the disturbing and chilling truth behind everything. In 1981, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren document the exorcism of 8-year-old David Glatzel, attended by his family, his sister Debbie, her boyfriend Arne Johnson, and Father Gordon in the town of Brookfield, Connecticut. During the exorcism, Arne invites the demon to enter his body instead of David's. Ed witnesses the demon transport itself from David's body to Arne's whilst he suffers from a heart attack, and is taken to a hospital in a comatose state.The following month, Ed wakes up at the hospital and reveals to Lorraine that he witnessed the demon enter Arne's body. She sends the police to the kennel and warns them that a tragedy will occur there. Arne and Debbie return to their apartment located above a kennel where Debbie works.",horror,"[[[ 2  1  0]

410,tt15509244,"DivorcÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©e Helen books a 'beginners' Appalachian Trail survivalist course. While seeking her brother Duncan before leaving, she finds his best friend Jake so asks him to give him the keys to housesit.

When Helen's ex Mike calls, reminding her their sixth wedding anniversary would have been today, she has a flashback. Both Jake and Duncan were at the wedding, disapproving of the very awkward Mike.

Northbound Helen pops in to see Gigi, the grandmother who'd raised them, on her drive from Pittsburgh. Staying in the designated Connecticut motel, the next morning the young guide Beckett gives them an overview of the hiking trip. They introduce themselves and 40ish Helen discovers she's one of the eldest participants, which fellow hiker Hugh happily points out. Then she is shocked to see Jake introduce himself.

Confronting Jake afterward, as he won't leave, Helen tells him to not interact with her and keep their connection quiet. Shortly after the bus drops the group off at the 50+ mile hike's starting point, Helen gashes her leg on a rock. Jake, a doctor and therefore the designated EMT, dresses her wound and congratulates her on her divorce.

After a short time, Helen gets scolded for stepping on a log, one of many rules they should have learned beforehand. Beckett shows them how to put up a bear hang to protect them and their food. Helen's tentmate Windy is 'crushing on' Jake, but Helen sees him as immature.

The next morning, Helen asks Jake for help with blisters as she didn't bring the correct footwear and didn't prevent it. Beckett casts some of the blame on Mason, the Wall Street hiker, for not being a team player and pushing everyone.

Windy tries to promote positive thinking. Everyone gets to know each other, Hugh sharing that he had been an aspiring actor but now sells insurance. When they are next alone again, Helen confronts Jake about his staring and hovering. He says he simply fears her returning to Mike, as he's not good enough for her.

As they have been hiking for ten days, Beckett has them rehike a route, grouped according to speed. He insists Mason go with the slower hikers to promote team-building. Before leaving, Beckett has a fit when he finds Helen's goal list which had fallen from her pocket. Noone fesses up to owning it. Jake, who knows it was hers, quietly calls her out for it, then hands her something to read later.

In Helen's hiking group, they gossip about Jake and Windy, suggesting there is chemistry. A quick kiss is mentioned. While everyone else is checking the map, Hugh foolishly plays balance beam with a rotten log. Severely damaging his leg, as Mason freezes up, Helen offers to go for help.

Helen explains what happened when she reaches the lead group after nightfall, and they decide to go find them at dawn. Sharing a tent with Jake, she tells him her middle brother Nathan had drowned when she was six. Helen felt responsible, and the family unraveled with first their dad, then their mother, leaving them. They both act jealous: Jake over her accepting Mike's constant messages and Helen over his kiss with Windy, although it was during a game of Truth or Dare.

Waking at dawn, Helen takes the other three to Hugh and company. She and the men carry him on a makeshift stretcher to an awaiting ambulance three miles away. The next day, they all relax and chat and when dusk falls, Helen seeks out Jake who has departed from the group in the woods. Grateful, he hugs her then explains he inherited a degenerative eye disease causing him to slowly lose his sight. It currently affects him most at night and is the reason why he couldn't find them and stopped practicing medicine. They nearly kiss but are interrupted.

The next day they head for the bus, which takes them back to the motel. Meant to participate in karaoke and other farewell activities, Helen ducks out after overhearing that Jake has someone at home. Driving to Gigi's, she can only think of him. Finally reading what he had written her (a poem by Pablo Neruda), she discovers he has feelings for her. Gigi sees the trip has changed her and thinks she might be in love.

Duncan comes over, and Helen apologizes for how she's treated him over the years and vows to be a better sister. Duncan insists Helen go out with him and Gigi to celebrate a birthday. Jake shows up and they finally kiss after he confesses he's loved her for years.",romance,"[[[255 255 255]

412,tt15481952,"Fictional retelling of the lifestyle and scandals of Hunter Biden, son of US President Joe Biden. This is not a true story ... except for all the facts.""This is the opening lines of the movie, voiced by an omniscient narrator, played out by a Secret Service agent who appears through the movie. In this setup, the movie starts off.Next a series of news snippets are inter played as the media is shown portraying the  protests by BLM and Antifa in a manner that satirizes the situation, juxtaposing actual scenes of arson against the news anchor's statements of peaceful protests. Two protesters are then shown discussing the suppression of information for ""the good of the people.""This morphs into the first scene of Hunter Biden, and one of his many parties that throw around cash, sex, and drugs. At the end of this first scene, with the revelers mostly asleep and strung out, there is a humorous presentation of a small dog, using dialog bubbles to tell Biden he's being used by freeloaders who don't really care about him. Agreeing with the dog, Biden orders everyone out of his apartment.We then see Hunter meet up with another recurring character in the movie, named Grace Anderson, who spends much of the movie as a combination of Hunter's girlfriend, savant, and moral conscience. Her first interactions show Hunter entering a drug purchase, followed by the first of many intimate conversations about their lives and troubles.Next enters Joe Biden into the movie, meeting with his son Hunter in the back of a VicePresidential motorcade, discussing the laptop that Hunter Biden abandoned at a computer repair store. They discuss how the laptop became the property of the store owner. They discuss how the FBI now has the laptop and how Joe Biden needs to know what's on the laptop so he can work to create cover stories in the media.This limo scene is interrupted by scenes of Grace meeting with one of Hunter's personal assistants. This assistant then works with Grace to try to find web articles to discuss what Hunter had previously told her took place. Being unable to find any information that matched what Hunter had told her took place, Grace is told she must find other websites to find the background information she seeks. Grace then consults those other websites and finds her corroborating information.The Secret Service agent then provides a brief summary of the convictions these Biden associates received, while describing some of their most significant criminal actions, as well as the financial details of the Hunter Biden business deals. This is when the movie first portrays Joe Biden telling an audience how he forced the resignation of a Ukrainian prosecutor, who was investigating Hunter, in return for a  billion loan guarantee by the Obama administration.The story then returns to the limo, where Hunter and Joe Biden end their conversation with the mention of removal of travel bans against Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs in return for Hunter no longer being prosecuted, along with revealing a smear campaign against the computer store owner by portraying him as a Russian agent.Following this, is another extended scene between Hunter Biden and Grace Anderson, where the two discuss the Peoples Republic of China. In this exchange, details of Hunter's business deals with Chinese business leaders are played out in character. It is during this scene where the apartment manager evicts Biden due to the salacious nature of his many parties. This extended scene concludes with Anderson speaking about Chinese human rights violations, as well as confronting Hunter on the true roots of his actions and selfdestructive behavior.Hunter Biden's personal assistant then gives to Grace a recording of her many conversations with Hunter Biden, a recording she tries to give to a freelance journalist named Bob, who is working at the time for the Washington Post. This journalist is shown as refusing to accept the story and urging Grace to forget all about it. Grace then posts the information she has online, and is shown immediately suffering social media cancellation and attacks.The final scenes play out showing Rudy Giuliani accepting Grace's invitation to meet, releasing the recordings. The movie concludes by showing the aftermath of the public release of these conversations, prior to the  election, that force the FBI to accelerate their criminal investigation of Hunter Biden, as well as force mainstream media to retract their previous denials of the laptop information. This culminates in a revisionist outcome of the  election in which Donald Trump is reelected by a wide margin, presumably due to the controversy created after the media reports the details of the Biden business deals and Hunter Biden's personal lifestyle, as well as other media reports of Hunter Biden being arrested by the FBI for various charges.These revisionist narratives are then stopped, showing a concluding scene of Grace refusing to release the recordings, and lamenting what could have been if she had done so. She reconciles with her estranged father in an embrace and final statement that perhaps, ""in the end, the truth itself has become the fairy tale.""The movie fades out with several real world media clips as well as actual video of Joe and Hunter Biden and their activities. These clips show  efforts by mainstream media to castigate the New York Posts' laptop articles as being Russian disinformation, followed by reports they made in  and  that the laptop information is genuine.",comedy,"[[[ 84  85  80]

415,tt6718170,"A plumber named Mario travels through an underground labyrinth with his brother, Luigi, trying to save a captured princess. A Brooklyn plumber named Mario travels through the Mushroom Kingdom with a princess named Peach and an anthropomorphic mushroom named Toad to find Mario's brother, Luigi, and to save the world from a ruthless fire-breathing Koopa named Bowser. The film starts in an ice kingdom of blue penguins where a large menacing ship belonging to the Koopas. Once they land, the Koopa army emerges to confront the penguins. Kamek (Kevin Michael Richardson) comes out to introduce their king, the sinister Bowser (Jack Black). While the penguins attempt to (pathetically) fight back, Kamek uses his magic to throw them to the side before Bowser unleashes his fire breath to melt the penguins' ice castle. He then goes to a box with a question mark and crushes it, revealing the Super Star. Bowser then boasts that there is nobody who can stop him.In Brooklyn, brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are watching a commercial for their new plumbing business. They get mocked by their ex-boss Foreman Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco), but Mario steps in to defend his brother since Luigi is nervous and easily afraid. Moments later, the brothers get a phone call for their first big job. Unfortunately, their van breaks down, forcing them to run across a construction site to make it to their destination.The brothers arrive at the home of a wealthy couple, where Luigi already makes a bad impression when he steps on the toy of the couple's dog, Francis. Mario quickly fixes their leaky faucet, but Francis goes after them. This leads to the bathroom getting more wrecked and Francis nearly falling out the window until Mario and Luigi save him.The two return home where they live with their family and are having pasta with mushrooms (and Mario hates mushrooms). Their parents don't have faith in their plumbing business and write it off as a silly dream, leaving Mario dejected. Luigi goes to comfort his brother, who says he wishes he didn't always feel so small. They then see the news that there is a massive pipe burst in downtown Brooklyn, and Mario thinks only he and Luigi can fix it.Mario and Luigi make it underground as the streets start to get flooded. They find the source of the problem and start to climb their way to the main pipe, but they end up falling deeper into the sewers until they come across a system of pipes. The brothers get pulled in through one of the pipes and are taken through portals, where they are separated.Luigi ends up in The Dark Lands, where he is found by skeletal Koopas called Dry Bones. They chase him until he runs toward a castle where he thinks he is safe until little masked minions (Shy Guys) end up capturing Luigi.Mario ends up in a land full of giant mushrooms. He meets a little mushroom-headed creature, a Toad named...Toad (Keegan-Michael Key). Mario explains to Toad that he got separated from Luigi, and based on his description, Toad figures Luigi is in The Dark Lands. He guides Mario to The Mushroom Kingdom so they can get help.Mario and Toad arrive at the castle of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). She knows Bowser is a threat and is making plans to face off against him with the help of the Kong army after he took the penguins, prisoner. Toad helps Mario sneak into her castle, and Peach is ecstatic to meet another human. Mario asks for her help in finding Luigi, and she says she will once she sees what he is made of.Peach shows Mario an obstacle course that he must go through to prove himself. She does it effortlessly in one go, and she shows him the power-ups that he can use, but unfortunately for Mario, they're mushrooms. He eats one that makes him bigger and stronger, but whenever he gets hit, he loses the power-up. Mario endures hours of falling platforms, man-eating flowers, and wrecking balls. On his last try, he nearly makes it before the flower chomps on him, but it's enough to convince Peach that Mario can help fight Bowser. Peach departs from the Toads as they head to the Kong Kingdom, but they are joined by Toad.Before their journey, Peach demonstrates an ability to Mario to produce fire using a flower. He asks where she came from, but Peach isn't sure. She remembers coming to the Mushroom Kingdom as a lost child, and the Toads raised her before making her their princess.Aboard the Koopa ship, Bowser explains his plan to marry Peach and rule together with her using the Super Star. Later, Bowser sings a piano ballad to himself before Kamek comes in to inform him that Peach has been spotted with Mario, making him super jealous. The Shy Guys bring in Luigi, whom Bowser tortures (yanking his mustache hairs) for information on his brother.Mario, Peach, and Toad arrive at the Kong Kingdom to speak to Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen) over gaining his army to fight Bowser, but he refuses. Mario steps up, determined to save Luigi, so Cranky agrees to help on the condition that Mario fight Cranky's son in the arena and win. Mario agrees, despite Peach saying it's a bad idea.In the arena, Mario is pitted against Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen). Naturally, the much smaller Mario initially gets whooped by DK, until he starts to take advantage of power-ups. His first attempt goes poorly when he eats a blue mushroom that makes him tiny. He then gets another power-up that gives him a cat suit, which allows him to use cat-like reflexes against Donkey Kong. The ape throws barrels at Mario, but he dodges them and uses his power to punch DK down below, defeating him. Cranky agrees for the Kong army to help Peach.Luigi is imprisoned alongside the penguins and their king (Khary Payton), along with a cheerful (but grim) little star called Lumalee (Juliet Jelenic). Bowser also learns about the Kongs' alliance with Peach, and he plans to stop them.The heroes assemble karts to go after the Koopas. They ride across Rainbow Road to head after them, but Bowser's army ambushes them. The Koopas attack, but Mario and the others are able to fend most of them off. Toad almost falls off but Peach rescues him. A Koopa General (Scott Menville) tries to use his rig to kill Mario, but he avoids the attack and blows up the General's vehicle. The General gets angered and activates his blue shell, performing a kamikaze attack that destroys part of the bridge and sends Mario and Donkey Kong falling into the ocean. The Kongs are captured, and Peach rushes back to the kingdom with Toad to warn everyone.Mario and DK argue as they fall into the water, but DK is knocked out by a falling kart tire. Mario saves him but they are both devoured by a gigantic Maw-Ray. They find a rocket from DK's cart and use it to blast themselves out of its stomach and on their way back to the Mushroom Kingdom.Peach returns to get the Toads to evacuate, but Bowser and his goons show up. He offers his proposal to Peach, who immediately refuses until Bowser orders Kamek to torture Toad. Peach then agrees as long as the Toads are unharmed. Kamek then goes to the other prisoners to announce that they will be sacrificed.The wedding ceremony is about to go off until Bowser presents the sacrifices. Peach then says she was never going to marry him and takes in a blue flower to give herself ice powers. She freezes the mechanism and Bowser while the Toads begin to fight the Koopas. The mechanism breaks apart and the prisoners are lowered further into lava, with Luigi nearly dying first until Donkey Kong arrives, having been powered-up with Mario, to raise them back up. Luigi falls until Mario shows up in a Tanooki outfit that lets him fly. Bowser breaks free from the ice and orders a Bomber Bill to be launched at the Mushroom Kingdom to obliterate it. Mario flies in Bill's eye and gets the giant bomb to chase after him, leading him to the portal pipes where Bill explodes. The ensuing explosion causes everyone in the kingdom to get pulled in.Everyone ends up back in Brooklyn, including the Koopa ship. A now enraged Bowser attacks Mario and beats him down, saying he has no chance to stop him. While Peach and DK try to fight, Mario hides in the pizzeria and sees his commercial with Luigi, inspiring him to keep up the fight. Bowser loses the Super Star, and Mario tries to grab it, but Bowser lets out his fire breath until Luigi steps in to shield Mario with a manhole cover. The two then run to the Star and touch it, making them invincible and powerful, officially becoming THE SUPER MARIO BROTHERS! They plow through the Koopas and proceed to kick Bowser's butt before slamming into him together and annihilating his ship. Now weakened, Peach feeds Bowser a blue mushroom to turn him tiny, and Toad traps him in a jar. Mario and Luigi's parents, the people of Brooklyn, and even Spike cheer for the brothers for saving everyone.Later on, Mario and Luigi continue their plumbing business, only they are now residing in the Mushroom Kingdom. The brothers hop into a portal pipe for another adventure.Mid-Credits Scene: Tiny Bowser tries to sing a song in his cage before Toad tells him to shut up.Post-Credits Scene: In the sewers of Brooklyn, a little egg with green spots begins to hatch, and a little voice calls out...""Yoshi""",comedy,"[[[148  20 191]

416,tt13964404,"In July , an experienced outdoor enthusiast vanished in Northern Nevada while on an outdoor excursion. After an extensive search, he was never located. On the threeyear anniversary of his disappearance, friends and loved ones recall the events leading up to his vanishing, and for the first time, speak about the horrifying conclusion of his fate. In the style of a documentary film, the first part focuses on the police ""missing person"" report of amateur hiker Gary Hinge Toward the end of July , Gary hiked to an unspecified area in the Great Basin Desert Nevada. His starting point was the town of Ruth and his target was presumably a cabin he had approached on a previous expedition. When he was two days past his estimated return date and did not return home, his housemate Simon Rodgers alerted Gary's sister, Beverly Hinge, who in turn notified the police. More than a week had passed since Gary had last been seen.Initially, the police conducted a search based on the last GPS location of Gary's cell phone. Local and state police were involved, as well as park rangers and even volunteer groups. A few days later, it was reported that Gary's truck had been found,  miles from his departure in Ruth, Nevada, at the end of a dirt road at the bottom of a small hill. This finding prompted search parties, who covered large areas on foot, by helicopter and with the use of drones. None of the groups were able to find any trace or indication of Gary's location. When several more days passed without any news, the police terminated the search, as they considered that the chances of finding Gary alive were already practically nil, due to the fact that he used to travel with minimal supplies, water and equipment, which left him at the mercy of the weather the hottest time of the year and other dangers, such as the local fauna or the fact that there are multiple abandoned mining pits in the area. As time went by, the media stopped reporting on it. Subsequently, Beverly hired a private investigator, William 'Bill' Salerno, so that the case would not be abandoned. A reporter from a local media outlet, Gal Roberts, decided to convince her editor to keep on top of the story, lest it be forgotten as a ""cold case"". Thus, the investigation then focused on the clues that could be obtained from the truck, now considered a crime scene. Two aspects stood out; first, numerous fingerprints that did not match Gary Hinge's were found all over the truck, especially on the steering wheel. In addition, a trail of barefoot footprints, also not matching Gary's, was found.",horror,"[[[255 255 255]

Three long, prosperous decades after Prince Akeem and Lisa McDowell's opulent wedding in Coming to America , King Jaffe Joffer and Semmi, sensing that trouble is brewing in the African kingdom of Zamunda, drop a bombshell. As a result, with three lovely daughters and no sons, Prince Akeem's back is against the wall as General Izzi, the megalomaniac despot of the neighboring country of Nexdoria, dreams of seizing power through a political marriage of convenience. Now, newlycrowned King Akeem and his trusted confidante Semmi must return to where it all began, the bustling borough of Queens, New York, to retrieve Lavelle, the illegitimate son unsuspecting Akeem never knew existed. Can the prince of Zamunda restore peace and stability in less than a week?Nick Riganas"", 'On the th anniversary of his wedding with Lisa McDowell, Prince Akeem of Zamunda is summoned before his dying father, King Jaffe Joffer. Jaffe and his shaman Baba reveal to a baffled Akeem that he had sired a son during his first visit in Queens, New York, after his aide Semmi had enticed two women into spending the night with them while Akeem was still searching for his future queen. One of them inadvertently drugged Akeem, resulting in a tryst he did not remember. As Zamundian tradition demands that only a male successor can inherit the throne, and Akeem has fathered only daughters, Akeem is forced to travel back to Queens to retrieve his son. If not, Zamunda could face a hostile takeover by Zamunda's militaristic neighbor nation Nexdoria, whose dictator, General Izzi the brother of Imani, Akeem's original arranged bridetobe, has been pushing for Akeem's eldest daughter Meeka into marrying his foppish son, Idi.Following King Jaffe's funeral and Akeem's ascension to king, he and Semmi travel back to Queens to find his illegitimate son. During a lighthearted reunion with the barbershop gang they bonded with, head barber Mr. Clarence informs them that the son in question is Lavelle Junson, a ticket scalper who hustles outside of Madison Square Garden. After an awkward reunion with Lavelle's mother Mary, Akeem takes them back to Zamunda, much to his family's displeasure. When General Izzi learns of this, he drops by to introduce his daughter Bopoto to Lavelle as a last shot at laying claim to the throne of Zamunda, but in order to qualify as a royal prince, Lavelle first has to pass a series of traditional  and hazardous  tests.Lavelle is at first highly reluctant to place himself in danger, but then bonds with Mirembe, a royal groomer, who tells him of Akeem's quest to find his queen and encourages him to follow his own path. Lavelle then invites his uncle Reem, Mary's streetwise brother, to Zamunda who coaches him on how to blend his urban upbringing with his new royal status. Lavelle gradually develops an understanding with Akeem's family and, using his wits and some forced courage, he passes and is made Prince of Zamunda. However, at his accession party, Lavelle overhears a conversation between Akeem and Izzi which makes him believe that Akeem is just exploiting him, and he, Mirembe, Mary and Reem go back to New York. Upset at losing Mary, whom she has befriended, Lisa locks Akeem out of their bedroom. After a pep talk from his fatherinlaw Cleo, who reminds him of late Queen Aoleon's progressive mind, Akeem flies back to the States, while Semmi is left to stall Izzi, who intends to return the next day to either see Bopoto marry Lavelle or declare war.Returning to Queens, Akeem finds that Lavelle and Mirembe are about to get married. Confronted by Lavelle and reminded of his own life story, he gives them his blessing and releases Lavelle from his marriage to Bopoto. When Mirembe expresses reluctance in the couple cutting all of their ties to Zamunda, Akeem offers to fly Mary's family back for a proper wedding. In the meantime, Semmi and the princesses, all trained staff fighters, fight off and subdue General Izzi when he invades the palace, forcing him to try a more diplomatic approach. Upon his return home, Akeem changes the royal succession by allowing his daughter Meeka to ascend to the throne upon his death, while Lavelle is made an ambassador to the United States, and General Izzi has opened Nexdoria for a peaceful political and trading relationship. The film concludes with a grand party at the royal palace to celebrate Lavelle and Mirembe's marriage, including the barbers from Queens as special guests and a performance of the song ""We Are Family"" from Sexual Chocolate.copied from Wikipedia.",comedy,"[[[243 234 217]

Chicago, December 1973. Thirty-three years after the events of A Christmas Story (1983), Ralphie Parker is now a married man with a family of his own. And excited about Christmas, Ralphie heads back to his memory-laden childhood home in Indiana with his wife and kids in tow to spend the holidays. As he reconnects with his mother and old friends, determined to make this the happiest Christmas ever, Ralphie has to live up to the family's holiday-celebrating expectations, even though he doesn't know where to start. Can Ralphie pull off the impossible and surprise everyone with a memorable, magical Christmas?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas. The film follows an adult Ralphie in 1973, who returns to the house on Cleveland Street to deliver his kids a magical Christmas like the one he had growing up. Ralphie reconnects with childhood friends like Flick, Schwartz, encounters childhood bullies like Scut and reconciles the passing of his Old Man. In December 1973, 33 years after the events of A Christmas Story, Ralphie Parker (Peter Billingsley) lives in Chicago with his wife Sandy and two children, Mark and Julie. Ralphie has been taking the year off from his job to write his first novel, but its excessive length leads multiple publishers to reject it. Mrs. Parker (Julie Haggerty) calls to tell Ralphie that his dad, ""the Old Man"" (played by the late Darren McGavin), has died, and the grief-stricken family makes its way to Hohman, Indiana, to be with her. She gives Ralphie two tasks: write his father's obituary and take up his mantle of making Christmas special for the family.Ralphie's children befriend one of the Bumpus kids next door and are bullied by two children on a snowmobile. Ralphie reunites with Flick (Scott Schwartz), who now owns his father's old tavern, and Schwartz (RD Robb), who still lives with his mother and has run up a large tab at Flick's. While leaving the house to go ice skating, Sandy falls, slips on ice and sprains her ankle.As Christmas Eve approaches, the family goes to Higbee's, where Ralphie miraculously buys everything Mark and Julie asked for while their children wait in line to see Santa. On the way back, Ralphie's car breaks down again and Ralphie accidentally injures Julie in the eye during an impromptu snowball fight, which requires a trip to the emergency room and a temporary eye-patch. All of the gifts are stolen from the car's popped trunk when the family is inside the hospital, and Sandy has little money left to replace them.Back at Flick's, Flick offers to forgive Schwartz's tab if he completes a physical stunt, the ""Ramp"". Schwartz succeeds and his tab is forgiven, but afterwards Mark breaks his arm sledding and Ralphie is rejected by his final prospective publisher. After some comfort from Sandy and remembering the Christmases of yesteryear, Ralphie suddenly gains a burst of inspiration and writes a piece that far exceeds the length of a normal obituary. However, he leaves it on the desk, needing to prepare for Christmas Day. Mark and Julie manage to get back at their bullies by building a snowman over a tree stump so that their snowmobile crashes.That night, though, Julie becomes upset after the tree's star falls and breaks. Ralphie, frustrated, goes out against his wife and mother's urging to find a new one. Because all of the stores are closed, Ralphie breaks into Flick's tavern to ""borrow"" the star from the tree. On his way out, he is caught and apprehended by Scut Farkus (Zack Ward), now a Hohman police officer. Ralphie is terrified at what Scut will do to him, but Scut brings him home, saying he owes Ralphie because their fight set him on a better path in life.On Christmas morning, Ralphie is confused by compliments he receives about his piece in the newspaper. Sandy reveals she found the obituary manuscript and took it to the local paper, and its high quality led to it quickly being syndicated. Ralphie is offered a new job as a syndicated columnist, fulfilling his dream of leaving the rat race and becoming a full-time writer. Opening presents, it is discovered that the Old Man had bought and personally wrapped very thoughtful gifts for the family shortly before his death. Much of the town soon comes to the Parker house for Christmas dinner along with Randy (Ian Petrella). After dinner concludes, the core family asks Ralphie to read his story about the Old Man. Ralphie takes a seat and begins to read, fully embracing his new role as the Old Man's successor as his narration of it transitions into Jean Shepherd's from the original film.",comedy,"[[[240 240 232]

Govind ""Govinda"" Waghmare aka GovyaGovindya, works as a backup dancer for films in Mumbai, and wishes to be a choreographer someday. He has a bitter relationship with his wife Gauri, and wants to divorce her, to be with his girlfriend Suku who is also a dancer. Gauri demands that in order to divorce her, he would first have to pay her Rs  crores, returning the amount paid to him in dowry at the time of their marriage. Gauri has a boyfriend named Baldev, who is an insurance agent.Govinda's father, Gopi Vishwakarma, was a famous action director and his mother, Asha Waghmare, was a backup dancer. They fell in love while working together in films and got married. When Govinda was little, Gopi died in an accident and Charulata and Vishnu Vishwakarma, Gopi's wife and son from his first marriage, claim that they are the rightful owner of the bungalow which Gopi had left for Govinda and Asha in his will. The Vishwakarma family claim that Gopi's marriage with Asha was a sham and was just part of a film shooting. It has led to a long running legal dispute between the two families over ownership of the bungalow. Asha has been pretending to be paralyzed in order to gain sympathy and move the case in their favour.Govinda thinks of killing Gauri and takes a gun from Inspector Javed, an old friend of Gopi's, but he cannot muster the courage to kill her. Javed demands Rs  lakhs for the gun but Govinda is unable to pay him and gets threatened by him regularly. Govinda and Suku get an opportunity to choreograph a music video for the rich producer Ajit Dharkar's drugaddicted son Sandeep aka Sandy. The music video is made, but Govinda and Suku have more screen time in it compared to Sandy, which angers Ajit and he demands that they repay him Rs  lakhs, which was the amount spent in making the song.Sometime later, Govinda finds Sandy injured in his car post an accident. With him being unconscious, Govinda finds and steals drugs from his car, which are worth crores of rupees and Suku suggests they sell them. They both go to Govinda's house and are shocked to find Gauri lying dead on the floor, seemingly murdered. They are clueless as to who may have killed her, and bury her in the garden outside the house, removing all other evidence. The next morning, Manju, the maidservant discovers a piece of broken glass on the floor with blood stains on it. She suspects Govinda for killing Gauri and reports it to Inspector Javed.It is revealed that Suku had been working for Vishnu and passing on information to him which would help him in the case regarding the bungalow. Baldev confronts Govinda and says that he suspects him for killing Gauri as he knows that she had made a life insurance worth Rs  crores with Govinda as the nominee, and he says that he knew nothing about it. On their lawyer Kaustabh's suggestion, Govinda and Asha decide to sell the bungalow to the Vishwakarma family for Rs  crores and settle somewhere else. Meanwhile, Sandy is shocked to find the drugs missing from his car. Ajit receives an anonymous tip that Govinda has the drugs, and has him detained by the police, along with everyone else who knows him.The police search for the drugs at his house, but cannot find them. On being questioned, Suku says that Govinda has murdered Gauri and buried her. The police dig up the ground outside the house but cannot find Gauri's body, which leaves Suku shocked. Moreover, Govinda unexpectedly claims that him and Gauri are already divorced and he doesn't know of her whereabouts. Some of the drugs are surprisingly found at Inspector Javed's house, leading the police to believe that he had stolen it. The Vishwakarma family, after acquiring the bungalow, finds out that Gopi had illegally acquired the land in which it was built and that a school will be built there. This creates problems for them as they have already sold the bungalow to a real estate developer for Rs  crores. A raid is conducted at Ajit's house and on finding more drugs in his possession, the police detain him.Six months later, Suku, Vishnu and Charulata receive a call from Govinda to come and meet him in Thailand. On reaching there, they are shocked to find Govinda living a luxurious life, along with Asha and Gauri, who is alive. Govinda reveals that he had found out that Suku had betrayed him and was working for Vishnu. He, along with Gauri and Asha, had made an elaborate plan in which they would fake Gauri's death to get the insurance money, steal and sell the drugs from Sandy by framing Inspector Javed, and sell the bungalow for a hefty sum, fully aware that it was illegally acquired. Baldev and Kaustabh were also in on the plan and had received their respective shares.

A notorious serial killer, Edward Brady, is facing execution at 11pm. Dr. James Martin is brought in to replace Dr. Alan Fischer who committed suicide after interviewing Edward. Edward's fate now depends on Martin's diagnosis. If Martin decides that Edward is sane, he will be executed, but if he declares him to be insane, Edward will be spared. ""Edward"" claims that he is possessed by a demon named ""Nefariamus"", and also says that Martin will commit three murders by day's end. Martin initially dismisses Edward's claims, but as the demon's knowledge of Martin's life proves uncannily and disturbingly accurate, Martin's skepticism begins to fade. The weight of Nefarious' claims both frighten him and fill him with self doubts. With Edward's fate hanging in the balance, Martin must make a fateful decision based on his professional diagnosis, while grappling with his personal feelings of fear and disgust, and the conflict of interest they create. A psychiatrist named Dr. Alan Fischer nervously moves around his office. After writing his will, he commits suicide by jumping off the building's roof.In a state penitentiary, Fischer's protÃ©gÃ©, psychiatrist Dr. James Martin, arrives to interview a notorious serial killer and death-row inmate named Edward. Before meeting Edward, Martin meets Warden Tom Moss, revealing that Fischer had been evaluating Edward just before his suicide. Edward is scheduled to die by electrocution (the method he chose himself) that very day. Moss says Edward's fate depends upon Martin's diagnosis: if Martin declares Edward sane, he will be executed but if he is declared insane, as Fischer believed, Edward will be spared.Martin meets Edward who is confident and knows so much information about Martin that it leaves him at a loss. Edward insists he is not a human but a demon inhabiting Edward's body and named ""Nefariamus,"" a name Satan gave him- ""Nefarious"" for short. Martin does not believe Nefarious is who he says he is and thinks instead that it is an act by Edward to seem insane, however he is surprised when Nefarious insists that he wants to be executed, or rather, that he wants Edward to be executed. Nefarious also declares that before the day is over, Martin will commit three murders.",horror,"[[[19 72 66]

She would rather party, get drunk or stoned instead of sitting hours on the toilet. But she can't ignore it. Is it her or the baby? Rakel loves to draw comics, try her hand at aikido, drink beer and party. When her best friend Ingrid points out her large breasts and altered sense of smell to Rakel and persuades her to take a pregnancy test, she gets a nasty surprise she is indeed pregnant. Rakel already had many plans for her life, wanted to become an astronaut or a forester, but being a mother is definitely not one of them. But ""This is Norway. I can have an abortion,"" she tells herself and drives to the clinic. There, to her horror, the doctor tells her that she is already seven months pregnant and an abortion is no longer possible. Not every pregnant woman gets a belly. Thus begins the search for the child's father. Unfortunately, Mo, the likeable aikido teacher who smells of butter and accompanies Rakel to the clinic appointment, is out of the question in this case. Three others do, and in the end she has to accept that Pikkjesus is probably the one with whom she unintentionally fathered a child during casual sex. This unsympathetic loser, of all people. Rakel, desperately angry about her fate, scribbles her unborn baby with a Zorro mask on a piece of paper and gives it the nickname Ninjababy. The little cartoon ninja baby is as amusingly obnoxious as Rakel herself, but above all unimpressed by its own father ""Did you really let him fuck you?"" it taunts the man Rakel refers to as Dick Jesus.",comedy,"[[[252 255 255]

436,tt14499608,"Life With Luca is a spinoff movie based on the television series Life with Derek. The film picks up 15 years after the finale as Derek and his daughter Skyler prepare to move in with aunt Casey and her extended family. Derek returns as the single dad of a 14-year-old daughter, and yes, he did find success as a musician. Casey is a successful lawyer and mother of three, and her oldest, Luca, also 14, provides the antics Derek brought in the original series. The teenager loves video games, pranks, and frustrating his rigid mother. When their parents build a new house, Derek and Casey pay a visit to the homestead and reunite for the first time in a long time. This time, however, they are actually happy to see each other -- it's their teens who are now at odds. Karma, or something like that. After Queens University, Derek moved to Paris and became a successful musician, though whether as the guitarist for D-Rock or not has yet to be confirmed. He's now the single dad of a 14-year-old daughter, Skyler, who turns out to be just as quick-witted as her father, but is also studious and is now giving Derek a taste of his own rebellious behavior as she begins to test her boundaries. Meanwhile, Casey graduated from Queens U and went on to become a lawyer (did we expect anything less?). She's a married mother of three, living in Toronto, and parents with a pretty firm hand. In a turn of events, Casey's eldest, 14-year-old Luca, loves pranks, video games, and skateboarding, and especially loves to push Casey's buttons. Spin-off of the long-running, beloved franchise Life with Derek that picks up fifteen years later and follows Derek and Casey as they each navigate parenthood and raise distinctly different teenagers. Derek is a successful musician in Paris and the single dad of a 14-year-old girl named Skyler who is smart, funny, and studious and who has recently been testing the boundaries set by her father. Casey is a lawyer and a married mother of three in Toronto and is quite comfortable setting limits, though her eldest, 14-year-old Luca is constantly crossing them. Both Derek and Casey spontaneously decide to surprise their own parents at their recently constructed 'forever home' in rural Ontario but encounter each other instead. Casey and Derek are happy to see each other, but the teenaged cousins -who have barely seen each other over the years (and never really liked what they saw)- don't get along at all, uniting only to get into serious trouble.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—themoviedb""]",comedy,"[[[255 255 255]

Unable to explain the origin of his extensive encyclopaedic knowledge, the skills he has acquired, and the memories of places he has never visited, tormented, pill-popping Evan McCauley has been plagued by strange, vivid hallucinations all his life. On the verge of a mental breakdown, Evan finds himself caught in the middle of an aeons-long confrontation, as the Believers and the Nihilists, two groups of the gifted Infinites extraordinary people blessed, or cursed, with the rare gift of reincarnation vie for power. Now, the Nihilists' feared leader, Bathurst, seeks to end all life on Earth. Is Evan a part of the Infinites' master plan? Above all, are one's fragmented memories evidence of multiple past lives?

Treadway tells Abel that if he does not survive, the latter must remember to ""look inside"". He drives off a bridge, jumping from his car in mid-air and onto another bridge 150 feet away. However, Treadway watches helplessly as Bathurst arrives and kills Abel and Leona.In 2020 Evan McCauley suffers from schizophrenia. Because of past institutionalization and violent behavior, he cannot get a job. Needing meds, he forges a katana for a local gangster, even though he was never trained as a bladesmith. After the deal goes south, Evan makes his escape but is later arrested. A man at the police station introduces himself as Bathurst. He starts to refer to Evan as Treadway and claims they have known each other for centuries.When Bathurst gets Evan to remember things about his past life, a car slams into the room. Evan's rescuer is Nora Brightman, who takes Evan to the group she is part of. There are about 500 individuals in the world who can remember all their past lives, known as the Infinites. Two opposing factions have developed among the Infinites: the Believers and the Nihilists. The Believers, such as Nora, think remembrance is a gift bestowed to them by a higher power to make the world better. Nihilists like Bathurst consider it a curse. They think the Infinites are condemned to witness humanity self-destruct. They want to be free of this and exterminate all life on Earth.",action,"[[[106  76  22]

A take on Clive Barker's  horror classic where a young woman struggling with addiction comes into possession of an ancient puzzle box, unaware that its purpose is to summon the Cenobites, a group of sadistic supernatural beings from another dimension. During a party at hedonistic millionaire Roland Voight's mansion, sex worker Joey comes across a mechanical puzzle box, which Voight insists he solve. Joey solves the configuration and is stabbed by a blade that springs from the box. A portal opens, from which chains fly out and rip Joey apart.Six years later, recovering addict Riley is living with her brother Matt, his boyfriend Colin, and their roommate Nora. Riley's boyfriend, Trevor, convinces her to help break into an abandoned storage warehouse, where they discover and take the puzzle box. Returning home late, Riley gets into an argument with Matt and leaves. At an empty park, she solves the box and avoids being cut by the blade. The Cenobites, a group of mutilated humanoids, appear and demand she choose another sacrifice. Matt finds Riley blacked out and, as he tries to wake her up, inadvertently cuts himself on the box. He goes to a nearby restroom to clean his wound. Riley hears him scream and discovers that he has vanished.Believing the box caused Matt's disappearance, Riley and Trevor track down Serena Menaker, Voight's former lawyer, who had hidden it in the warehouse. Menaker tries to take the box from Riley but is inadvertently cut by the blade and later taken by the Cenobites. Riley visits Voight's abandoned mansion, finding his journals and learning that the box has multiple configurations, each of which requires a victim to be ""marked"" by the box's blade for the Cenobites to take.",horror,"[[[0 0 0]

444,tt12530246,"A runaway slave forges through the swamps of Louisiana on a tortuous journey to escape plantation owners that nearly killed him. Over 150 years from today, back in 1863 at Lousiana, a black slave, Gordon, had dreamt of the freedom of black people. Freedom means living their life to the fullest, just like their ""White"" masters: who considered themselves god of 'these Animals'. 'Emancipation' is a tale of a black slave who fought his whole life to live with honor, dignity, and of course, a ""Normal life"" This is the tale of a person who risked his life to join the Lincoln Army, fighting to free his fellow brothers-sisters-sons-daughters. This image of Gordon was taken in 1863 after he managed to be free from his slave master. This is the most accurate depiction of slavery I've seen. In America in 1863, Peter is a black American forced into rigorous manual labour in plantations and subjected to torture by the owners. When slavery is abolished by President Lincoln he escapes and is chased through jungles and swamps by his oppressors. Does he achieve freedom after undergoing suffering ?",action,"[[[145 145 145]

With her vindictive suitor intent on taking her fathers throne, the princess must save the kingdom. The film is set in a medieval realm ruled by a King and his Queen, who have two daughters, the titular Princess and her younger sister Violet. With the Queen's quiet approval, the Princess was trained in the fighting arts by Linh, the niece of Khai, one of the King's advisors. Since the Queen did not bear any sons, the King had intended to wed the Princess to Julius, the ruthless son of a royal diplomat, who despises the King's peaceful reign because of his belief that a ""strong"" king should rule with an iron fist. The Princess left him at the altar, and as a result, Julius, his whipwielding henchwoman Moira, and a band of brutal mercenaries have taken the castle by force, seizing the royal family and their retainers.The Princess is locked in the top of her castle's highest tower to await her forced wedding with Julius. When two mercenaries enter and prepare to rape her, she kills them and sets out to rescue her family. After she slays several mercenaries on her way, Julius and Moira are finally alerted and send their men after her. She evades her pursuers and meets up with Linh, who has escaped the castle's sacking and joins in her fight. While trying to reach the sewers, en route to the dungeons, they are forced to fight Moira, and Linh stays behind to stall her. The Princess frees her family, but they and Linh are quickly captured and brought before Julius.

In Imperial China, Hua Mulan is an adventurous and active girl, to the disappointment of her parents, who hopes that one day she will be wed to a good husband. As a young woman, Mulan is forced to meet with a matchmaker to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife. Mulan, flustered, attempts to pour tea in front of the matchmaker, but a spider causes a panic that destroys the kettle, and the matchmaker calls her a disgrace in front of her family.To the north, an imperial outpost is invaded by Rouran warriors, under the leadership of Bri Khan. They are assisted by the witch Xianniang, who uses her magic to pose as a surviving soldier and report the attack to the Emperor of China; he then issues a conscription decree ordering every family to contribute one man to fight Khan's forces.Imperial soldiers arrive in Mulan's village to enlist recruits and her elderly and frail father Hua Zhou is forced to pledge his service as he has no sons.

456,tt1086064,"Once told they'd save the universe during a timetraveling adventure, two wouldbe rockers from San Dimas, California find themselves as middleaged dads still trying to crank out a hit song and fulfill their destiny. The film starts with Wihelmina ""Billie"" Logan Brigette LundyPaine and Thea ""Theodora"" Preston Samara Weaving telling the story of their dads, Bill S. Preston, Esq Alex Winter and Ted ""Theodore"" Logan Keanu Reeves. They went through time and Hell to create great music as the Wyld Stallyns, but after achieving big success at one point with multiple record albums, their music quality began to decline, and the world seemed to care less about them. Meanwhile, their actions have caused reality to bend, sending historical figures to different eras Jesus switches places with Kid Cudi, for instance. To this day, they have not written the song that will unite the world.In the present day, Bill and Ted are at a wedding to perform for Ted's younger brother Deacon Beck Bennett and Missy Amy Stoch, who married both Bill and Ted's dads first. The guys play a mishmash of instruments in their attempts to create their big song, but it just sounds bad, and Ted's elderly dad Jonathan Hal Landon Jr. thinks Bill and Ted are just washed up losers who waste their time and have been poor role models to their daughters, while also saying that their wives, Princess Joanna, ""Jo"" Jayma Mays and Princess Elizabeth, ""Liz"" Erinn Hayes, are the only real adults in their families, but Billie and Thea still believe in their dads.Liz and Jo bring their husbands to couples therapy, even though the intention was to do it separately. They talk to Dr. Wood Jillian Bell, where it is apparent that Bill and Ted can't do anything without each other, even tell their own wives ""I love you"". Liz and Jo admit that while they love their husbands, they do feel that the two are just going through are a routine that they can't grow out of.Bill and Ted go home feeling upset over how they are viewed, with Ted even thinking of selling his Les Paul guitar to make money. Suddenly, an eggshaped time machine appears. Out steps Kelly Kristen School, the daughter of the guys' previous timetravel guide Rufus who had apparently passed away some years earlier. Kelly tells Bill and Ted that they need to go with her. Billie and Thea watch as their dads hop in the time machine. The guys are taken  years into the future in San Dimas, California where Kelly brings them to meet her mom, The Great Leader Holland Taylor. She explains to the guys that since they still haven't written the song that will unite the world, and worse still time and reality have begun bending in an event called ""The Unraveling"", and if the guys can't produce the song within less than  minutes  PM specifically, reality is doomed. Kelly gives them a pocket watch from her father that will keep track of time in San Dimas. Bill and Ted know they won't have enough time, so they decide to try and go into their own futures to steal the song from themselves when they think they have already written it. They hop inside their old time traveling phone booth and head out.The guys end up in  to find their future selves are performing at a lounge for people who aren't even listening to them. PresentBill and Ted confront their future selves and learn that they have become bigger failures, not only in their music, but Liz and Jo left them after their own future selves showed them that there is no happy life with them, and their own daughters have stopped talking to them. The guys rush back to their present timeline to find their wives in therapy again, where they beg them not to join their future selves, but they still have a hard time saying ""I love you"" to them. Liz and Jo then see their future selves in their own time machine and head out. Dr. Wood also sees a historical figure appear on her couch, and she leaves.Back in the future, the Great Leader tells Kelly that perhaps the only way to bring balance back to reality is to have Bill and Ted killed. She sends a timetraveling cyborg called Dennis Anthony Carrigan to hunt the duo. Kelly then uses her time machine to go back to present day San Dimas to find Bill and Ted, but instead finds Billie and Thea, and the two decide they want to help their dads unite the world. They use the machine to go back to  to meet Jimi Hendrix DazMann Still and try and recruit him for their song by uniting some of the greatest artists in history. Jimi is uninterested, so the girls realize they'll need bigger inspiration.Meanwhile, Bill and Ted go to  where they come across a large mansion, thinking they have made it big as rock stars by now. They find their future selves dressed in flashy clothes and speaking with posh British accents that they say they got from timetraveling with their wives through the Medieval ages. They give their past selves what is supposedly the song that will unite the world for them to take back to their time, but as they are leaving, PresentBill and Ted discover that the mansion belongs to Dave Grohl, and their old selves are actually balding, fat, alcoholics who are even worse than their  selves. Jonathan and Deacon arrive with the SWAT team after Dave calls the cops, and since FutureBill and Ted know what their past selves are going to do, PresentBill and Ted come up with a crazy plan to cover their heads with buckets so their future selves won't know where they went. The guys make it to their time machine, just as Dennis arrives and prepares to vaporize them, but he is too late, as the guys leave, and he accidentally zaps Jonathan. He ends up in Hell where he is greeted by Death William Sadler.Billie and Thea go to  to find Louis Armstrong Jeremiah Craft where Billie shows him a video she recorded of Jimi onstage. Louis is impressed and goes to  with the girls to meet Jimi. Although he still appears to not want to do it, especially since Louis Armstrong would be an old man at that time, Louis plays his trumpet, which is enough to convince Jimi to join them. They then take the two artists all the way back to Vienna in  to find Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Daniel Dorr. They hear him performing one of his pieces, and Jimi takes out his guitar to mimic the notes. Mozart is impressed by what he hears and joins the team.Bill and Ted then go to  where they find their future selves in prison, both of them jacked and tattooed. They took the fall for breaking into Dave's house, and now they plan to beat their past selves for it. However, Dennis shows up and attempts to kill PresentBill and Ted, which PrisonBill and Ted know will mean that they will die too. They get the inmates to pile on Dennis as PresentBill and Ted make their escape.Billie and Thea bring the three musicians to China in  B.C. to meet Ling Lun Sharon Gee, the founder of music in China. Mozart plays her bamboo flute, and she joins them. The girls take them even further into the past to North Africa where they meet a dimmer called Grom Patty Anne Miller. They convince her to come along as well. With their band assembled, the girls return to present day San Dimas, where Kid Cudi also appears with time and reality still unraveling. He seems to understand the paradox that is occurring, just as Dennis shows up. He accidentally vaporizes everybody, as well as Kelly, and sends them all to Hell.Bill and Ted decide to go all the way to the end of their lives, which is somewhere in . They find themselves super old in a retirement home. They present their younger selves with a flash drive containing their big song, called ""Face The Music"" and labeled ""PrestonLogan MP "" MP is where they need to go. As they prepare to head back, Dennis shows up to get Bill and Ted, but his programming won't allow him to kill them since they have the song. When they learn that he sent their daughters to Hell, Bill breaks the flash drive to get Dennis to kill them, but Dennis instead has a nervous breakdown and tries to kill himself. Bill and Ted jump into the path of the laser, which Liz and Jo see as their machine brings them to that time.The guys end up back in Hell and go searching for their daughters. They find them, as well as Jonathan, who realizes that everything Bill and Ted told them about time travel and death was true. After reuniting, they figure that they can get back to Earth with Death's help, but he had a falling out with Bill and Ted after they kicked him out of Wyld Stallyns for performing overlong solos. Billie and Thea talk to Death, as they are actually fans of his bassplaying, and they convince him to give their dads another chance. After Bill and Ted apologize, Death uses Jonathan's SWAT van to bring the family, and the historical musicians, back up to Earth.Everybody arrives in the present day  on Interstate , which is where MP is. All of time and space starts coming undone, with monuments and other figures start jumping to other time periods and locations. Dennis gives Bill and Ted the pieces of the flash drive, but they still don't know how to write their big song. They then realize that the ""PrestonLogan"" is not them, but rather Thea and Billie, as they are the masterminds behind the big song, and their dads are their to back them up. The girls give instruments to their band members, which doesn't sound too great at first until they start to get things in sync. Liz and Jo show up and tell the guys that the happiest timeline with them is the one they are in now. Bill and Ted finally individually tell their wives they love them, and they all go through history to give everyone instruments to play, thereby actually uniting the whole world in song. When the guys return, they play epic guitar solos for the whole world to hear. Reality begins to set itself back to normal. Kelly and Dennis return to the future, where the Great Leader commends Kelly for her work, and everyone returns to their regular timelines. Billie and Thea end with their narration on how their dads helped unite the world by getting everyone to play together.The end credits show people all over the world playing music together. After the credits, we see Old Bill and Ted checking up on each other before standing up to do another epic guitar solo.",comedy,"[[[ 3  1 12]

Twin brothers Elias and Lukas return home to live with their estranged mother, a former actress, after staying with their father since their divorce. Upon seeing her again, they are disturbed to find her wearing a full bandage over her whole head, resembling a white balaclava. Mother who is never given a name explains she has had cosmetic surgery. She gives the boys some house rules, which include not entering her room or the barn outside. While playing outside in the field, the boys discover the barn. Exploring inside, Elias finds old toys of theirs. Mother discovers they've been in the barn and chastises them, proclaiming that from then on they will stay indoors.The boys quickly sense something strange about Mother, who does not seem interested in reconnecting with them; she drinks heavily, appears angry, and will not sing the lullaby she always used to sing to them as children. Elias also discovers Mother has thrown away a drawing he made of the three of them, which upsets him. During the night, Elias overhears Mother talking on the phone; she says she cannot go on pretending and wants him gone.After seeing an old headshot of Mother with green eyes, who now has blue eyes, the boys begin to question whether the woman they are living with is really their mother. When they attempt to contact their father, Mother breaks their shared cell phone. One night while she is taking a bath, Elias attempts to remove the skincare face mask she is wearing; an argument ensues and, after Elias tells her she is not their mother, she slaps him, then sprays him with freezing cold shower water until he admits he is wrong.Terrified of Mother, the boys leave in the middle of the night and attempt to seek help from a nearby house, which they discover is abandoned. They break in to spend the night but are found by two local state troopers who take them back to Mother's house. Mother, who has now removed her bandage, insists they are imagining things and says to police that Elias injured his lip from slipping near the pool.The following morning, Mother wakes to find her arms and legs tied to the bed with duct tape. She demands to be let free, adamant she is their mother. She explains she wore green contact lenses as an actress, claiming they are downstairs in her purse. Lukas tells Elias he searched the purse and did not find them. Elias suddenly feels uneasy about leaving Mother tied up and in pain, but Lukas persuades him to go, branding her a liar. While waiting for a taxi nearby, Elias returns to the house, claiming he forgot to pack his toothbrush. He looks in Mother's purse and finds the contact lenses. Lukas appears and begs Elias to let him explain. Elias flees to the bedroom to free Mother while Lukas disappears.Mother takes Elias to the barn and shows him a bullet hole in one of the walls that is covered in blood. Upon seeing it, Elias breaks down; it is revealed Elias accidentally shot and killed Lukas, meaning Lukas has been a hallucination the entire time. His death sent Mother into a griefstricken depression, resulting in her divorce and estrangement from Elias. Mother attempts to console him, but in a confused rage, he lashes out and pushes Mother from the barn loft; her lantern smashes in the process, resulting in a fire. Elias flees and tearfully watches the barn burn to the ground. Elias has a hallucination of Mother and Lukas who appear at his side. With a smile, Mother tells him he has done nothing wrong, and they embrace.",horror,"[[[ 81 110  92]

However, in the process of fulfilling their missions, Kresna himself discovers a new meaning to his life and his love for NURSE LINDA.', ""A man named Kresna leads a life far from beautiful. He is shaken by depression to the point of attempting to end his life. His attempt fails after he is rescued by authorities, and he is subsequently admitted to a hospital for recovery. The recovery process becomes a moment when Kresna meets Nurse Linda, who works at the hospital to care for him. Their relationship starts off as usual, but Kresna discovers a newfound attraction and meaning in his life. However, alongside this, he also experiences strange occurrences while at the hospital. Kresna finds himself followed by four ghosts and can even see and interact with them. The quartet of ghosts has different characters and backgrounds. Bima is a smoking ghost who used to work as a public minivan driver. Kuatno is an old womanizer ghost, while Lita appears as a melancholic female ghost who is easily brought to tears. The quartet of ghosts is completed by Chika, a young ghost who enjoys wearing roller skates. The presence of these four ghosts surprises and initially disturbs Kresna, although their antics are humorous.

The ghosts eventually reveal that they will always follow Kresna wherever he goes. If he wants to be free, Kresna must help them fulfill their requests. Unable to refuse, Kresna starts to make an effort to fulfill the missions given by each ghost.

471,tt14230388,"Following a writer on his world famous fictional play about a grieving father who travels with his techobsessed family to small rural Asteroid City to compete in a junior stargazing event, only to have his world view disrupted forever. In a retrofuturistic version of the s, a television host introduces a live production of Asteroid City, a play in the film's setting by famed playwright Conrad Earp. In the play, a youth astronomy convention is held in the fictional desert town of Asteroid City. The play's events are depicted in widescreen and stylized color, while the television special is seen in blackandwhite Academy ratio.In the play, war photojournalist Augie Steenbeck arrives early to the Junior Stargazer convention with Woodrow, his intellectual teenage son, and his three younger daughters. When their car breaks down, Augie phones his fatherinlaw, Stanley, asking his help. Stanley, who dislikes his soninlaw, persuades him to tell the children about their mother's recent death, which Augie had concealed. Augie and Woodrow meet Midge Campbell, a famous but worldweary actress, and her daughter Dinah, who, like Woodrow, will be honored at the convention. Augie and Midge, and Woodrow and Dinah, gradually fall in love throughout the play. The other convention participants arrive fivestar General Grif Gibson, astronomer Dr. Hickenlooper, three additional teenaged honorees Ricky, Clifford, and Shelly and their parents J.J., Roger, and Sandy, a busload of elementaryschool children chaperoned by young teacher June Douglas, and a cowboy band led by singer Montana. A local motel provides everyone's accommodations.Gibson welcomes the attendees at the Asteroid City crater where the teenagers are to receive awards for various inventions. A UFO suddenly appears above the crater; an alien emerges and steals a fragment of the meteorite that created the crater. Augie photographs the alien. General Gibson with instructions from the president, places the town under military quarantine, and everyone is subjected to medical and psychiatric examinations. Meanwhile, a romance blossoms between Montana and June, who assure the students that the alien is likely peaceful. The Stargazer honorees use Dr. Hickenlooper's equipment to attempt to contact the alien. Using a guarded pay phone, Ricky calls his school newspaper to relay the quarantine details and coverup to the outside world.The Asteroid City events become national news. A furious General Gibson is about to end the quarantine when the UFO reappears and the alien returns the meteorite fragment. When Gibson reinstates the quarantine, the children, scientists, and parents revolt, using the honorees' inventions to overpower the military.The play's creation is interspersed between the play. Some time after Conrad Earp started writing, he meets with actor Jones Hall, who performs an audition in Earp's home and is immediately cast. During the same interaction, Earp and Hall kiss, establishing their relationship as lovers. Earp writes the play with help from a local acting school and recruits most cast members from it, including Mercedes Ford, a temperamental yet talented actress who plays Midge.During the recorded performance of the play, Hall, who plays Augie, confronts the play's director Schubert Green, saying he ""still doesn't understand the play"", and asks Green if he is ""doing him right"". Green tells Hall to keep playing Augie the same way despite being uncertain, and that he is doing him right. After that interaction, while taking a smoke break on a balcony, Hall runs into the actress who was cast to play Augie's wife before her only scene was cut. She recites the deleted scene's text to him.Six months into the play's run, Conrad Earp dies in an automobile accident. In the play's epilogue, Augie and his family are the last to leave Asteroid City after General Gibson lifts the quarantine. Augie's daughters bury their mother's ashes in the desert, Woodrow wins the fellowship funding, and Midge leaves Augie her mailing address. Augie and his family quietly drive away.",comedy,"[[[ 90 208 196]

475,tt11024272,"Two years after Cole survived a satanic blood cult, he's living another nightmare high school. And the demons from his past? Still making his life hell. Two years after the events of the first film, Cole is now a junior in high school. He is unable to convince anyone except for his best friend Melanie that a satanic cult led by his former babysitter Bee really tried to kill him. However, Cole finds out his parents have applied him in a psychiatric school, and he escapes with Melanie alongside her new boyfriend Jimmy, and their friends BoomBoom and Diego to join a lake party. At the party, Cole witnesses new student Phoebe, who has arrived at the lake after finding her missing childhood stuffed toy and directions to the lake in her locker. Later, Cole's friends play a party game on a boat when Melanie suddenly kills BoomBoom. She then reveals to Cole that she believed him because she had joined the cult to achieve her dreams of becoming a famous influence, with Jimmy and Diego also revealed as cult members. With BoomBoom's blood as a sacrifice, they need his blood again as an offering of an innocent to make their wishes come true. Original cultists Sonya, Allison, Max, and John also appear, having been resurrected so they could partake in the ritual or else they would die by sunrise. However, Phoebe suddenly appears, looking for gas for her jet ski, and provides Cole with some time to evade the cult members and escape with Phoebe on her jet ski. Once on land, Cole explains everything to Phoebe, who believes him, while the cultists give chase. Sonya is first to attempt to kill them, but they end up running her over with a car left by a stranger and is then decapitated with a surfboard after it flies off the car. Allison finds them, but the two trap her between a narrow wedge of rocks and then they proceed to rip her head off. The two board a boat and drive off, but Max catches the raft attached to the back of the boat and is able to pull himself onto the boat. However, Phoebe sets him on fire with a can of silly string and a lighter and Cole mutilates him with the boats propeller blades. Diego and Jimmy supernaturally disintegrate when they attempt to back off from their pursuit of Cole. Cole and Phoebe arrive at Phoebe's old family cabin, where they take refuge and hope to wait out the night, having been brought there from the mysterious message Phoebe received. In the cabin bunker, Phoebe reveals to Cole that her parents died because she crashed into them in a fatal car accident. Cole comforts her and admires her strength, and the two have sex. Melanie calls Cole's dad Archie, who has been frantically searching for him alongside Melanie's father Juan, and fakes being drunk so that he can pick them up, hoping to lure Cole out. Cole and Phoebe come out of the bunker armed with crossbows and John accidentally kills himself when a chandelier crashes on him. Cole and Phoebe flee and, after Archie follows after them, Melanie kills her father. Cole tells Phoebe to run away while he faces his father, who drugs him so he can take him home. Melanie and Phoebe face off in a fight, which ends with Melanie capturing Phoebe at knifepoint so she can serve as bait. While stopping for gas, Cole regains consciousness, locks Archie out of the car, and drives back to the lake to save Phoebe. In a cove, Melanie holds Phoebe hostage before Cole shows up and volunteers to be sacrificed. Suddenly, Bee emerges out of the water and is revealed to be Phoebe's babysitter who was responsible for the car accident that killed her parents. It is then revealed in flashbacks that Bee made a deal with the devil so she could save Phoebe's life. Sonya, Allison, Max, and John are resurrected again, and the four alongside Melanie drink the blood of Cole mixed with BoomBoom's blood. However, since Cole has had sex with Phoebe thereby losing his innocence, the ritual backfires and the five melt and disintegrate. Bee, who did not drink the blood, reveals that she orchestrated everything so that Phoebe and Cole could unite and defeat the cult, having had a change of heart after Cole's love confession after her initial defeat. However, since Bee is still technically a demon, she drinks the blood and disintegrates to save the two. Archie shows up and, having witnessed Bee's death, now believes what Cole said was true. As the sun comes up, Cole and Phoebe embrace in a kiss. In a midcredits scene, Bee's demon book is shown on the sand, still intact.",comedy,"[[[215  10  77]

480,tt15206378," women find themselves dealing with a mystery killing. Who's the killer and what are the motives of the murder? A young woman named Susanna Diana Del Bufalo returns to her countryside home from Milan on the occasion of Christmas, as her family is supposed to spend a few days together. The first person she meets back at home is the new maid who came  months ago, Maria Luisa Ranieri, who rather coldly welcomes Susanna home and makes acquaintance with her. Gradually the rest of the characters are introduced as family members make their appearances. The family is headed by Susanna's father, Marcello Luca Pastorelli, and her mother, Margherita Margherita Buy. Margherita's elderly mother, Rachele Ornella Vanoni, and her spinster sister, Agostina Sabrina Impacciatore, have been living in the house for many years now, despite having moved in for a short stay originally. Perhaps the only family member most excited to have Susanna back is her younger sister Caterina Benedetta Porcaroli, who is also the youngest individual in the house. Noticing that Marcello is nowhere to be seen yet, Susanna asks to go meet him and learns that the man is still in his private bedroom, owing to the fact that he is not very well. After catching up with the rest of the family members, Susanna, Caterina, Rachele, Margherita, and Agostina all have breakfast while Maria serves them. After this, the maid takes breakfast for Marcello up to his room. Her shrieks, and then her reporting to the rest of the family, confirm that Marcello has been murdered inside his very room, with a knife stabbed into his back.The six women inside Marcello's grand house are stuck inside after the man's murder is discovered, for there is a blinding snowstorm raging outside. The women try to contact the police to report the murder but realize that the telephone lines have been cut. One of them thinks of driving away from the house but realizes that the car has also been tampered with, as wires under its hood are all cut up. Later on, Maria decides that she will leave the house on foot, but soon has to run back in and report that the main gate of the house has also been bolted shut by someone. Naturally, all the characters are sure that the murderer is among them, and this situation further complicates when a seventh woman, Veronica Micaela Ramazzotti, walks into the house. This new woman, who had actually been a longtime lover of Marcello, informs that she had been called up by some woman from the house who had told her something had happened to her lover and asked her to rush to the house.Each of the characters has their own secrets, which get revealed as the film progresses. Rachele, is introduced as someone who is unable to walk from the beginning of the film, as she needs to be pushed around in a wheelchair. However, this is later revealed to be her pretense of getting extra help and sympathy from everyone around, and she is actually able to walk very easily. Rachele is obsessed with her stocks, which are the only remaining wealth that she has. The woman always keeps the papers for these stocks under her bed, ensuring that they are always safe. A little while after the murder is discovered, these stocks are found to be missing, too, making Rachele suspect that one of the other women had not only killed her soninlaw but had also stolen all her money.nNext is Rachele's younger daughter and Margherita's sister Agostina, whose biggest complaint in life seems to be that no man has loved her till now. Agostina is revealed to have dearly loved Marcello, and she used to desire the man, too, despite the fact that he was married to her elder sister. Agostina had made multiple attempts to present her romantic thoughts to Marcello, but the man always avoided her advances in any way he could. Marcello himself was no less than a Casanova, as he had multiple lovers throughout his life, one of which was the new maid, Maria. The house used to have a different older maid earlier, who had strangely died one day after falling while she was cleaning the windows.nMaria had come into the house after this, as her sister used to work at a family house acquainted with Marcello's family and had subsequently fallen in love with the rich man. Margherita had no idea about this, but she, too, was tired of her married life since there was no love left between the couple. It is later revealed that Margherita was having an affair with Marcello's biggest business associate at the time, Sir Giannutri.On the other hand, Marcello always had a lover in his life named Veronica, even before he had been married to Margherita, and he kept in touch with Veronica even in presentday times. She had had to share her past lover Marcello, and her house with Margherita, since the house in which the latter and her husband lived was actually the family house of Veronica. But as fate would have it, Veronica also has to share her present lover with Margherita, for she, too, has been having an affair with Sir Giannutri.nMargherita's elder daughter, Susanna, has more than one secret of her own, one of which is a shock and surprise to her too. At present, she is pregnant with a child from her lover in Milan, and she keeps this news away from the family; this is soon revealed after some time. However, at this time, she learns that she is not the biological daughter of Marcello, whom she has always known to be her father, but was instead conceived by Margherita with a lover out of wedlock. It was while Margherita was pregnant with Susanna that she first met Marcello, who fell in love with her and married her soon after. Marcello needed Margherita's family fortune to buy his dream house.nLastly, there is the younger sister, Caterina, but she does not seem to have any secrets or anything suspicious about her, except for the fact that she locks up her father's room after the discovery of his murder, stating that nobody should damage the crime scene before the police arrive. But as things turned out, Caterina had the biggest secret of them all.Through a series of confrontations among the characters, it is revealed that each of them had met with Marcello the previous night without letting the others know. The man had gotten into some financial trouble in recent times, for which he had asked for help from Rachele, knowing that she had stocks on her. But Rachele met with him the night before and told him that she was unwilling to help him by parting with her life's savings. Agostina tried twice to enter Marcello's room and tell him about a love letter she had written for him, but the man managed to avoid her both times. Maria did go meet him with his midnight tea, and this was a pleasant meeting for the man for a change, as he was in love with her. Margherita had visited to tell her husband of something she had been planning for quite some time nowMargherita wanted to leave Marcello and had been preparing to do so by the end of the year. On the previous night, she had told him of her decision, apparently causing more stress for the man. Next came Veronica, who had a key to the house and Marcello's room owing to the fact that she had always been his constant lover. But now, she asked for money from Marcello, telling him that she wants to go to Paris and will return his money later.Susanna, who had apparently only come from Milan on this particular morning, had actually returned from Milan the previous night itself, for she wanted to tell her father of her pregnancy. She met him last, after all the previous meetings and asked for forgiveness and acceptance from her father. It seems that all these women had met Marcello for their own personal benefits and wellbeing. Even Susanna had similar intentions as she basically wanted her father to leave money for his grandchild in his will. Marcello had indeed been preparing a will, and he was probably all the more confused after this peculiar night. It was Caterina who played an instrumental role and helped her father ease his stress. The young woman had been hiding behind curtains and witnessed all of the meetings and understood how each of the women was trying to make use of Marcello. Taking this realization to her father, she helped the man prepare a unique plan. Marcello wanted to play dead and pretend that he had been murdered and then check how the women reacted to such a situation. This way, he believed, he would be able to understand who all genuinely loved him. He had made the two women he trusted the most at present part of this schemehis daughter Caterina and his lover Maria. It was these two women who had then set the whole scene, cut off all communications, and also called Veronica onto the scene. At the end it is revealed that there was no murderer at all, for Marcello had not been killed and was very much alive in his room. This was the reason, Caterina explains, that she had locked up the room immediately after the discovery so that the father would not have to play dead for long.Following all the confrontations and reactions that followed among the women after the discovery of the fake murder, Caterina is sure that the five have shown their true colors. Instead of grieving for the loss of the man from their lives, the women got busy with figuring out the murderer and finding out who would get Marcello's property. With all the revelations and these moral evaluations made, it is time for Marcello to step out from his hiding. Caterina opens up his room, and the six others rush in, only to find it empty. The open terrace door makes it clear that the man must have gone there, but more twist follows when the seven women reach the terrace. Marcello seems to have either slipped or jumped off the terrace onto the ground, on which he now lays, motionless and dead. The women now finally inform the police, who arrive on the scene, and they report it as Marcello having committed suicide. Caterina, who does not protest such reporting, is now told by the rest of the women that she should always stick to helping women instead of working against them. She asks whether that should be the case even if a man asks her to work against women, and her mother reassuringly tells her that should indeed be the case.Perhaps Marcello must have slipped and fallen to his death but having to report that to the police would also mean that everything else needed to be said. Instead, the women chose to say that the man had killed himself due to his recent financial struggles and move on with their lives. The patriarch was now dead, and there was no threat to any of the women's lives either. All seven of the women could live together off his wealth and have no conflict among each other, as is suggested by them at the end.",comedy,"[[[255 255 255]

486,tt11314148,"The film starts with the marriage of Gautam, an Indian Foreign Services officer, and Ira, a spirited social worker. Jaggi, a rank guest at the wedding, creates a scene and gets caught with his friends for gatecrashing the party. Jaggi later crosses the border illegally, intending to reach London but gets caught and taken back to the embassy where Gautam works. Jaggi explains to him that he has to reach London before Monday to his love, being inspired by Gautam's speech. The film flashes back to three months ago.

Jaggi, a hockey player, meets Kartika, a swimmer, and though the two get off to a rocky start, they start spending time together, teaching each other their sport. After a party, they have sex. Jaggi later learns that Kartika is getting married and asks why she didn't tell him. She replies that she was betrothed before meeting him and is sorry. He tells her that he truly loves her and she tells him that if his feelings are true, he should come to London after three months, in which case she will cancel the wedding. He tries to apply for a visa but fails to get one, and thus tries to go illegally.

After listening to Jaggi's story, Gautam admits that his philosophy was just a reception speech. Ira and Gautam are currently separated as Gautam had exposed to the government that a young boy selling food on the street was a refugee staying illegally. Ira, who felt sympathy for the boy, argued with Gautam over this and left him.

Jaggi has to be deported to India. He tries to escape, but gets caught when he suffers injuries while saving his fellow traveler Bilal. Due to some problem in documentation, Jaggi's flight is missed. Gautam has to keep Jaggi with him for 2 days till the next flight on Monday morning. On the way back home, Jaggi sees the other side of the English Channel and asks Gautam what lies on the other side. Listening to Gautam's reply, Jaggi gets excited and laughs that he can swim and cross the sea. Both spend some time enjoying, and on the way, Jaggi sees a dress and wishes to buy it for Kartika. For the first time in 3 months, ultimately, he finally calls Kartika to enquire about her dress size. She is shocked to hear Jaggi's voice. He says that he is in France and will try to reach there before Monday. She doesn't believe him and thinks he is joking, but her phone battery drains out before they can speak further. The next day, Jaggi persuades Gautam to make a step to his relationship and calls Ira, who wishes to talk it out. At the restaurant, Ira instead asks for divorce and tells Gautam to sign the papers. He angrily signs the papers and leaves. On the way home, Jaggi sees a swimsuit and desires to swim the English Channel wearing that swimsuit. Angry, Gautam takes Jaggi to a swimming pool and makes him swim continuously, believing that as the English Channel is 20 miles long it would be nearly suicidal to cover the entire length by swimming.

The next day, Gautam is surprised to find Ira at his doorstep, and realizes that Jaggi, who has gone missing, is responsible for having made the call to her. Jaggi leaves behind a letter, stating that he will try to reunite with Kartika, no matter what. He then enters the sea in order to reach the other side of the United Kingdom. Here, Gautam and Ira try to find him out but they fail. Kartika is also concerned for him because Jaggi called her from a P.C.O. and claimed that he is coming for her through the channel.

Jaggi swims long as he can go, but starts losing energy by the middle of the sea, and faints. He is saved by some strangers. Gautam informs Kartika that Jaggi is safe and that he tried to cross English Channel in order to reach her. He asks her if she would have really broken off her marriage in the event that Jaggi would have crossed the sea, but she is confused and doesn't have an answer. Seeing Jaggi's intense love for her, she falls in love with him. She confesses her feelings to Jaggi on phone and demands that he pick her up fast.

Seeing the love between the two, Gautam helps Jaggi get a passport with a United Kingdom visa illegally. When Ira asks Gautam why he is risking his career for Jaggi, he admits that he felt guilty since Jaggi was willing to go to unimaginable lengths to reunite with his love but he himself wasn't. For the last time, Jaggi goes to meet Bilal and tells him everything.

At the last moment when Gautam and Jaggi are about to board the plane, Bilal betrays Jaggi to the cops in return for a job, a house and legal citizenship. Seeing the police in search of him, Jaggi hides at the bottom of the plane.

At the end, it is shown that Gautam and Ira reunited back and Gautam was telling Jaggi's love story to his friends as they were remembering him, as he concludes saying that everyone has a story of love, and the only common factor binding them is the intensity of that love.",romance,"[[[255 255 255]

John Kramer Tobin Bell is back. The most chilling installment of the SAW franchise yet explores the untold chapter of Jigsaw's most personal game. Set between the events of SAW I and II, a sick and desperate John travels to Mexico for a risky and experimental medical procedure in hopes of a miracle cure for his cancer only to discover the entire operation is a scam to defraud the most vulnerable. Armed with a newfound purpose, John returns to his work, turning the tables on the con artists in his signature visceral way through a series of ingenious and terrifying traps. The movie opens with John Kramer Tobin Bell undergoing an MRI scan in a hospital, being told afterwards by a doctor that due to his advanced brain cancer, he has only months left to live. While John is at the hospital, he notices a custodian Isan Beomhyun Lee attempting to steal a patient's belongings. The custodian later wakes up in a trap set up by John, his hand caught in a mechanical contraption and two vacuum tubes hooked up to his eyes. He has  seconds to turn a dial that will activate the contraption, breaking all five fingers on his right hand one by one, or else his eyes will be sucked out by the vacuum tubes. He only manages to break three of his fingers before the timer runs out and he gets his eyes vacuumed out, however, the trap sequence is revealed to have taken place entirely in John's imagination, and the custodian puts back the patient's belongings after noticing John watching him.At a support group meeting for cancer patients, John comes across Henry Kessler Michael Beach, who claims to have terminal cancer and vows to keep fighting it until the end. Four months pass, and a bereft John is sitting in a coffee shop, about to sign his last will and testament, when he encounters a seemingly much healthier Henry, who claims to have been cured by an experimental cancer treatment given by Norwegian doctor Dr. Finn Pederson Donagh Gordon. After doing some research, John finds the website of Pederson's daughter, Dr. Cecilia Pederson Synnve Macody Lund, who is continuing her father's work and claims that corrupt pharmaceutical companies have been going after him, thus forcing her to perform further clinical trials of the treatment off the grid. John gets in touch with Cecilia, who refers him to her makeshift clinic in Mexico City for a surgery in two week's time.John travels to Mexico City and, upon arriving, is given a tour of the city by taxi driver Diego Joshua Okamoto, who takes him to the facility, located in a remote location just outside the city boundaries.

Paxton and Linda, a couple at the end of their relationship who are only still living together because of lock-down orders in the U.K. The two attempt to navigate their new situations as COVID-19 spreads around the globe; Paxton is furloughed from his job, while Linda is forced to fire employees from her company as they look to cut costs. Through his boss Malcolm, Paxton ""using a fake identity"" accepts work transporting goods and materials from places that are closing during the lock-down. One of his stops is a department store that's part of Linda's corporation. Dissatisfied with their current state of life, Paxton and Linda design a plan to steal an expensive diamond from the department store so they can become rich. Paxton and Linda are a couple trapped together in their London home due to the SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Paxton is furloughed from his delivery job, which he can't get away from due to his criminal record, and Linda, CEO of the UK division of a multinational media corporation, is forced to make her local staff redundant to cut costs. Making things worse, Linda wants to end things with Paxton, turning their home into a lockdown prison for them both. However, Paxton is given an opportunity by his boss to transport high-value goods over several days from London department stores to secure warehouses as the stores close during lockdown restrictions. To do so, he must use a fake identity so that his criminal past won't jeopardise his boss's lucrative contracts. Meanwhile, Linda finds herself the only person available to extract a $3 million gem that her company has on display in Harrods, one of the most costly, most secure department stores in the world, where Linda worked for several years. And Harrods is the last stop on Paxton's jobs, where their high security will see through his fake ID, with the blame falling on Linda. On a collision course through lockdown stress, opportunity, love, corporate greed, community pot banging, and destiny, Linda and Paxton plan to do something utterly audacious to change their lives and rekindle their relationship, and with the entire country locked down, it might just work.",comedy,"[[[  8   8   8]

One night, Anna and her best friend Charleen, a police officer, accidentally set the coffee shop on fire after enjoying a joint. Now blaming herself for the incident and totally broke, Charleen takes Anna to the underground allfemale fight club and introduces her to Bear, the manager and the referee of the fight club. There, Charleen explains to Anna that the winning fighter puts a dollar bill on the wall with their name on it and the fight club serves as a safe haven for women, who want to cope with the problems of their lives. Charleen persuades Anna that she must agree to fight in order to resolve her problems. Anna reluctantly agrees and fights in her first bout but is easily knocked out. Anna realizes that her mom founded the fight club and has fought several bouts, a secret that her mom kept from Anna her whole life, dying from cancer six months after her final fight.Anna is then introduced to former boxing coach Jack Murphy, who now works in a restaurant at the beach side and agrees to train her. She later meets Olivia, an undefeated fighter, who antagonizes her and Anna challenges her to a fight, which she accepts. As the days and her training progresses, she wins several fights.

However, they end their relationship after a drunken night. However, Anna did not take it seriously and ignores his advances.

Aided by her lawyer Chuck and the presiding judge Naomi Andrews, Mary's old friend, Anna is acquitted of all charges. Three months later, Anna has renovated the fight club and she agrees to fight with Charleen as a friendly fight. But the two get knocked out at the same time and call Roy for medical attention.

508,tt2235695,"While working for Mrs. Van Hopper, in Monte Carlo, a young woman becomes acquainted with Maxim de Winter, a recent widower. After a brief courtship, they become engaged. They marry and then head to his mansion in England, Manderley. She meets Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper, who was devoted to his first wife, Rebecca, who died in a boating accident. The staff and Maxim's friends also were fond of Rebecca. Mrs. Danvers emphasizes the new Mrs. de Winter's inferiority by comparison. Jack Favell, Rebecca's cousin, comes to visit, saying that Mrs. Danvers invited him. Learning of this infuriates Maxim, who banned Favell from the grounds, and accuses Mrs. de Winter of infidelity, which she denies. She confronts Mrs. Danvers for conspiring against her by inviting Favell, demanding her resignation. Mrs. Danvers insists Favell was lying.

The two begin working amicably together, with Mrs. Danvers assisting Mrs. de Winter in reviving the Manderley Costume Ball. Mrs. Danvers suggests that Mrs. de Winter choose a dress of a de Winter ancestor. When she wears the dress, guests are shocked and Maxim is furious. Mrs. de Winter learns that Rebecca wore the dress the previous year. Realizing that Mrs. Danvers had manipulated her and believing that Maxim now regrets their marriage, she flees. Mrs. Danvers reveals her contempt for the new Mrs. de Winter, believing she is trying to replace Rebecca. She tries to convince Mrs. de Winter to jump to her death from the window. However, she is thwarted by a nearby shipwreck brought from the storm. The ship is Rebecca's and her decomposed body is discovered on board.

This reopens the investigation into Rebecca's death. Maxim confesses to his wife that his marriage to Rebecca was a sham and that he always hated her. He states she was cruel, selfish, adulterous, and manipulative. On the night of her death, she told Maxim that she was pregnant with another man's child, which she would raise under the pretense that it was Maxim's. She placed his gun to her chest and stated that the only way to be free of her was to kill her. Enraged, Maxim pulled the trigger, then disposed of her body by placing it in her boat and sinking it. Despite his confession, Mrs. de Winter is relieved to know that Maxim loves her and resolves to support him during the investigation. Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim, claiming to have proof that Rebecca did not intend suicide, in a note she had written.

The trial shows Rebecca's boat to have been deliberately sunk. Testimony from Mrs. Danvers implies Rebecca's visit to a London doctor shortly before her death had to do with the pregnancy. The prosecutor produces Maxim's cheque written to Favell for the note, and Favell accuses Maxim of murdering Rebecca. Maxim is placed under arrest. At Manderley, Mrs. Danvers reveals that Rebecca hated all the men in her life. Mrs. de Winter fires Danvers and locates Rebecca's doctor and reads Rebecca's file, which reveals Rebecca could not have been pregnant because of advanced uterine cancer and would have died within a few months. An investigator concludes Rebecca committed suicide by scuttling her boat, while Mrs. de Winter privately concludes that Rebecca wanted Maxim to kill her.

Absolved, Maxim and Mrs. de Winter drive home to find the mansion ablaze. A maid reveals that Mrs. Danvers started the fire and fled. Mrs. de Winter races to the cliffs, and finds Mrs. Danvers standing on a precipice. She pleads with Mrs. Danvers not to jump, but Mrs. Danvers curses the two of them to never know happiness and jumps into the sea and drowns. Awakening from a dream years later, Mrs. de Winter is with Maxim, as they search for their dream home.",romance,"[[[160 108 121]

515,tt14799960,"An international film star's world collapses when her film director husband is outed by the paparazzi as having a baby with his new young leading lady. Seeking solace and healing, she escapes to a Caribbean boutique hotel resort. A British film star's world collapses when her British film director husband leaves her. Seeking solace and healing, she goes to stay with her British ex-pat cousin in Nevis. After two weeks in paradise she finds herself. And falls in love. Then the outside world comes crashing back in.Ã‚Â—MSR Media. MAGGIE RUSSELL (early 40\'s - Malin Akerman) - a famous American film star - has the perfect life - married to the perfect man (CHRISTOPHER - a trendy British film director - Jack Donnelly). Living in a beautiful London townhouse with a cottage in the country, a wardrobe to die for and an enviable set of credits, Maggie's reached a stage in her career where she wants to focus on more serious work - she's writing a script she hopes to direct.Everything seems possible until she wakes up to the paparazzi camped outside her door and discovers in the front pages of the tabloids that her husband is having an affair with the young starlet of his latest movie. When Maggie confronts Christopher by video call, he admits it's been going on for a year and that his girlfriend is pregnant. Maggie's phone rings like crazy but the only call she takes is from her cousin and oldest friend FIONA ""FEE"" HARRINGTON (50's - Connie Nielsen). Fiona tells Maggie to get on tomorrow morning's flight to Nevis where she runs a luxury hotel renowned for providing sanctuary and privacy - the ticket is already booked.When Maggie arrives on Nevis she is physically and emotionally exhausted. She crashes, sleeping for days at a time, walks on the private beach, sleeps some more, eats papaya, does some yoga. Sleeps some more. Slowly she recovers. She lies by the pool, shares breakfast on the terrace with Fiona and meets SAM CLARKE (American - 40's - Philip Winchester) the hotel's handsome, easy going, brilliant chef. Sam's a single dad bringing up his 4- year old son, DANIEL, while making legendary culinary magic in Fiona's kitchen. Sam lights a spark in Maggie. They start spending time together, Sam sharing his interest in growing organic vegetables and sourcing local products. He introduces Maggie to the two great passions in his life after Daniel: sailing and the cultivation of vanilla - a passion he hopes will become a source of income once he's able to own his own vanilla farm. As Maggie discovers the island and its wonders (the beaches, the volcanic peak, the food, the golden light, the people) she notices a gorgeous but dilapidated house for sale. It's where Sam grows the hotel's vegetables and dreams of growing his own vanilla.Eventually, inevitably, Maggie and Sam fall in love. Maggie realizes that there is no reason why she shouldn't live in Nevis. She can still go from film to film - she'll just come home to the island rather than London. Excited about the possibilities of a new life, Maggie's floored when Christopher tracks her down, the outside world invading her peaceful bubble. Returning to London to make sense of everything, Maggie realizes they have no future - it's not just her husband - it's the pace of life, the grayness and drudgery of the city, the shallowness of the work she's being asked to do. But mostly - she misses Sam.So she returns to Nevis, surprising Sam by buying the vacant farm. She's looking to the future - working on her own script, cementing her relationship with Sam, helping him realize his dream of the vanilla farm. But most importantly, she's rebuilding her life in the magical paradise of Nevis.",romance,"[[[138  40   1]

516,tt28690326,"Connected as a former pianist and cellist respectively who played together, best friends Ellie Matthews and Leo Carrington rarely see each other in living in different places, Ellie in the American city of Westerhaven, and Leo in the small Canadian town of Pinewood. Leo willingly moved on from his musical life to become the successful author of the Parkington Manor historical romance novel series. While the comfort of the familiar has worked for him in the past in not being an adventurous person, he having churned out a novel a year in the last fifteen years in the safety of Pinewood, he currently has writer's block as he is working to a deadline for number sixteen in the series. Julliard-trained Ellie, however, has moved from one career to another proverbially to ""pay rent, buy food, and buy clothes"", those career moves usually not her choice, although her move away from music was largely in self-doubt after a professional setback. When she is fired from her latest job as an event planner at an upscale hotel for being too distracted, Ellie suggests to an ultimately agreeable Leo that they switch homes for two weeks as a change of environment, for Leo to be inspired by new surroundings to unblock, and Ellie in trying to figure out what to do with her stalled life. In miscommunication, both are surprised by promises each made before leaving home affecting the other in the swap: Leo's that Ellie would help his friend and next door neighbor, Sam Perkins, owner/operator of the one-person business Pinewood Nature Tours, organize the town's annual fall fundraising event, the Piano Ball, but more importantly for Sam guide the string quartet in the fundraiser's centerpiece, a performance of Antonio Vivaldi's Autumn from ""The Four Seasons"", especially as classical musical is not the genre preferred by any of the members of the cobbled together quartet; and Ellie's that her friend, the hotel's executive chef Matt, could use her kitchen as he prepares for an investors' dinner for his own restaurant, he a bundle of indecision as the hotel has always dictated his menu. Both Ellie and Leo do not welcome the intrusion on the reason for the home swap, but ultimately commit to the promises made by the other, largely in they forming a connection to Sam and Matt. Burgeoning romances form between Ellie and Sam, and between Leo and Matt, as each inspires the other in the partnership in new directions in the other's life. What happens between each couple is affected by the success or failure of those new life paths.",romance,"[[[255 255 255]

Cassie Salazar and Luke Morrow couldn't be more different. Sharp-witted Cassie works nights at a bar in Oceanside, CA, to make ends meet while pursuing her dream of becoming a singer/songwriter. Luke is a Marine trainee about to ship out for duty, who finds comfort in the unswerving discipline of service. A chance encounter at Cassie's bar changes the course of both their lives. Cassie is drowning in medical bills after being diagnosed with diabetes.
Two young people, Cassie Salazar and Luke Morrow, have been taught to despise each other because of their different political identities - one progressive and one conservative. Then urgent circumstances (financial desperation) cause them to create a joint enterprise (a marriage of convenience), and they gradually learn that their political identities are not so important when the world throws a variety of challenges at them. Much more important are their personal qualities, such as empathy, integrity, consideration, loyalty, and fairness.

Charlie (Dan Stevens), his wife Michelle (Alison Brie), Charlie's brother Josh (Jeremy Allen White), and Josh's girlfriend Mina (Sheila Vand) decide to rent an ocean view house for a weekend getaway. After Mina's application for the house is denied for no reason, Charlie submits one and is accepted. Upon arriving at the remote property, the group meets the property owner Taylor (Toby Huss), whom Mina confronts for denying her application believing it was racially motivated.

Michelle uses drugs and calls Taylor to fix the hot tub. Mina privately confronts Taylor about the hidden camera, which Taylor claims to be unaware of and moves to call the police himself. Mina tries to stop him, which Josh witnesses and assuming Taylor is attacking his girlfriend, beats Taylor unconscious. As the group argues over what to do, Mina tells everyone about the hidden camera in the shower. After the group leaves Taylor in the bathroom to discuss what to do next, a masked man (Anthony Molinari) sneaks inside and smothers Taylor to death. When the others return and realize Taylor is not breathing, they assume that Josh has accidentally killed him.A frantic Michelle demands they call the police, but Charlie refuses to let his brother go to jail, suggesting that they stage Taylor falling off the nearby cliff into the ocean by accident.

They take the two to a cave where they meet a shaman that performs a Mayan ceremony to marry Marcus and Emily. Afterward, the two couples jump off the cliff into the ocean. They go back to the hotel room for more drugs and drinking, and Marcus passes out seeing Kyla on top of him, thanking him for the experience.The next morning, Marcus and Emily are super hungover and head over to the airport to catch their flight. When they arrive, Ron and Kyla are already there just hanging out, making inappropriate jokes about Marcus and Emily as security is nearby. Ron and Kyla want to continue seeing Marcus and Emily, and they ask if they can give them their numbers, but the latter couple pretends that their phones broke, so Ron gives Marcus his business card.Seven months later, Marcus and Emily are planning for their official wedding. Marcus, who manages a construction company, finds that his employees have gotten a suit for him. He laments not being able to invite them because Emily's parents want to keep it ""intimate"". When they arrive at the venue where the wedding will take place, Marcus is surprised to see that Emily's parents invited all of their family and other wealthy friends. Marcus has tension with her family because her father Harold Robert Wisdom doesn't particularly like him, and he also has issues with Emily's brother Gabe Andrew Bachelor because Marcus punched him in the face one time.Later that night, Ron and Kyla come crashing through the gate of the venue and pretend to angrily confront Marcus and Emily for not inviting them, before they burst out laughing at the gag. Harold approaches them, and Ron immediately wins him over by showing that he is a former Green Beret. Harold allows Ron and Kyla to stay in the one room that was available  the presidential suite. When Marcus and Emily ask them what they are doing there all of a sudden, Kyla reveals that she is pregnant, and they imply that Marcus had a big part to play in this, and based on what he remembers from the trip, he freaks out.The following morning, Harold invites Ron to join him and the others for a fox hunt, which doesn't actually involve hunting a fox, but rather chasing after one even though nobody has seen a fox around there in forever. Marcus and Ron go off together, where Ron shows Marcus which items to forage for food. Meanwhile, Harold expresses to Emily and Kyla that he didn't get along with his own fatherinlaw, and Emily notes the same thing is happening with him and Marcus. When the guys get to a special mushroom, Marcus eats it before Ron can explain that it is an extremely potent psychedelic mushroom. Marcus starts to trip balls almost instantly, so Ron eats one mushroom to help him. The two space out until Marcus is pounced on by what he believes is a fox attacking him. He nearly grabs a knife to kill it until Ron stops him to point out Harold and his group, revealing that the ""fox"" was actually Harold's dog playfully pouncing on Marcus. Harold tries to approach Marcus with respectful intents, but Marcus's hallucinations make him see Harold as a clown, and is unable to stop laughing. Ron steps in and saves him by saying that he knows Marcus wants nothing more than to make a good impression on Harold.Ron later joins Marcus as they go golfing against Gabe and his buddy Bennet Kamal Bolden, while Kyla continues to hang out with Emily and her family. Emily gets nervous because Kyla is giving ""special"" medicine to her Grandma Phyllis Denise Burse, who is typically quiet and doesn't move around too much because of her condition. While on the golf course, Ron appears super drunk and they keep missing every hole they come across. In the middle of the game, Ron takes out a lot of money, which he reveals he got from pawning off Marcus and Emily's wedding rings. Marcus is livid until Ron wagers with Gabe and Bennet for all the money, plus Bennet's Ferrari. Ron pulls off an impressive swing on the last hole to get a hole in one.The guys go to the pawnshop just before it closes, and Marcus gets the rings back. Ron sees a bird flying overhead, and because he earlier told Marcus that he knows when a bird is going to poop, he pushes Marcus out of the way just before he gets crapped on...and this causes Marcus to drop the rings down the sewer. He begins to freak out on Ron for causing all of this, and Ron starts telling Marcus that he helped Kyla conceive a child after doctors told him that he is sterile, seemingly confirming that Marcus really is the father of Kyla's child.That night, the family hosts a party, where Marcus's construction buddies show up after being invited by Ron. Ron and Kyla then go up on stage to announce to everyone how Marcus has lent a hand in helping them have a baby. Before Kyla can finish her sentence, Marcus tries to own up to it himself and declare to everyone that he is the father of Kyla's baby after they had the drugfueled sexual encounter. It actually turns out that this is not the case  after the couples did their cliff dive, Ron thinks that the impact the water landing had on his balls caused him to undo his infertility, and so he successfully impregnated Kyla. Emily stands up to admit that it was she who had sex with Kyla, and they were just on top of Marcus, who wasn't involved in it. Harold angrily berates Marcus, who then reveals that he lost the rings. When Gabe tries to berate him too, Marcus punches him in the face again. A brawl then breaks out between Gabe's friends and Marcus's construction buddies, and Marcus leaves dejectedly. On the way out, Ron and Kyla try to talk to Marcus and Emily, but the two of them snap at the other couple and say that they were never friends and deliberately avoided keeping in touch with them because of how crazy they are. Ron and Kyla are hurt and agree to leave.On the morning of Marcus and Emily's wedding, the two believe that there won't be a wedding. Harold then comes in with the construction guys, all of them very drunk. Harold has loosened up and admits to Marcus that he has been hard on him, but he is willing to give him another chance, which Marcus accepts. Emily is then visited by Grandma Phyllis, who is now able to walk thanks to the medicine Kyla gave her. She gives Emily a note and gift from Kyla, which is an apology to her and Marcus for ruining their wedding, but also an admission that the two of them felt like their best friends in forever, especially because Ron's own best friend passed away and he didn't meet another guy like that until Marcus came along. In the box is the wedding rings that Ron spent all day fishing out of the sewers. Marcus and Emily feel really bad and set off to go find Ron and Kyla.Emily remembers that Kyla mentioned she and Ron like to go to Waffle House, so she and Marcus go to multiple Waffle Houses until they eventually find Ron and Kyla. Although the two are still upset with Marcus and Emily, the latter two apologize, and Marcus kisses Ron's forehead, which he had earlier said is the ultimate sign of respect. They forgive Marcus and Emily, and they still want to name their baby after Marcus. They agree to go to the wedding on the condition that Marcus and Emily go to theirs.Months later, Marcus and Emily return to the cave in Mexico along with both their families and Baby Marcus to watch Ron and Kyla get married. The couples then all jump off the cliff into the ocean again.",comedy,"[[[255 255 255]

529,tt19755170,"A smalltown man who falls in love with the most beautiful girl in town. He wants to marry her one day because marrying her can raise his social position.Ajay Dixit Varun Dhawan is a History teacher but is embarrassed that he hasn't achieved more in life, and that is why he has lied to everyone he knows that he fell behind due to circumstances. He could have been a cricketer if not for his tennis elbow; he could have been an IAS officer but wanted to teach kids to be IAS instead; or he fell sick right before an important exam, which is why he is now teaching history instead of already being a part of it. These are some of the lies he has told around the whole town to ""maintain an image."" Ajay loves his image in town and wants to protect it at all costs.nThe Principal Shashie Vermaa of the school gets several complaints from fellow teachers who believe Ajay is a fake, but due to lack of any evidence, the Principal does not take any action.nAjay also lives with his parents and buys expensive items to maintain his aura in town. His dad refuses to fund his lavish lifestyle.Ajay married Nisha Janhvi Kapoor some nine months ago, but he has never liked her. Nisha told him before they got married that she had epilepsy, but since she hadn't had a fit in over ten years, Ajay decided it wasn't a problem for him. Ajay married Nisha because he thought she would help him enhance his image. While Nisha selected Ajay as she saw him as friendly and compassionate, not knowing that it was only his image.nHowever, on the day of their marriage, she had a fit, and since then, Ajay has been disappointed in her because he is embarrassed about other people finding out. He doesn't let her work a job or even take her anywhere because he is scared of what people will think of him if she has a fit again. Nisha has not left him because she has some hope.One morning in school, when he is in a particularly bad mood, he slaps one of his students Atul Nikhil Chawla for asking him a question related to the subject. Atul wanted to know why prisoners were stripped of their clothes before being taken to gas chambers in concentration camps. When Ajay couldn't answer, Atul mocked him for not knowing, hence prompting the slap.That gets him into trouble because the boy is the MLA's Vishwas Raghuvanshi Mukesh Tiwari son, and he gets involved. Ajay is suspended for a few days, and he could potentially lose his job, which he cannot afford because he wants to keep up his image.nTherefore, he comes up with a plan to go on a tour of Europe and visit all the places relevant to World War II so that he can teach the kids about them through a livestream, covering up the fact of his incompetence in the classroom. He plans on taking Nisha with him so that his father Mr Dixit Manoj Pahwa will agree to finance the trip, but he tells her that it is only for show, and he is not actually interested in their relationship.nWhen Nisha thanks Ajay, he retorts that he only included her so that his father would fund the trip. He actually wants Nisha to go to her home from the airport and meet him only once he returns.A fedup Nisha decides not to put up with his nonsense anymore and to go to Europe regardless. He could go his way, and she would do what she wanted. Unfortunately, though, things immediately go wrong for Ajay, and his bag is exchanged with another man Kalpesh Vyas Hemang, leaving Ajay with terrible clothes for the duration of his trip. He is also not able to figure out his day and how to go about the city, while Nisha goes on to have an excellent time. When they get back to the hotel, Ajay sees this and understands that he needs her help to navigate Europe, and Nisha agrees, saying that she isn't going to abandon him the way he did to her.Since Ajay is shameless and Nisha is a pushover, this couple sets out to explore the city, and it is Nisha who tells Ajay the facets of history that he then starts relaying to his students. Nisha narrates stories like how the people of Paris left their city when Hitler arrived, so that he would not ruin their beautiful city. But they cut the cables of the Eiffel tower, so he could not view the city from above.nThey hire an audio guide for  euros and relive the harrowing first hour of Omaha beach at Normandy on June th, . , soldiers died.nThey visit the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam.Nisha really comes through for Ajay by getting his mobile phone back from a thief, settling a fight, and even showing her resourcefulness by cooking food with the hot water from the bathroom. Ajay starts seeing Nisha as a person instead of someone he used to tolerate in his house. They start coming closer every day, and Ajay even starts getting possessive over her.nBack in Lucknow, his videos on history are a hit and are gaining good attention, despite the MLA insisting that a committee be set up to decide on his suspension.When a video of Ajay dancing with Nisha is uploaded by her on her social media page, it goes viral, and Ajay is furious since he believes that it could hurt his chances with his job. In his anger, he says some really mean things to her, and Nisha finally decides to leave him behind and sign the divorce papers back home.Ajay visits a Berlin Museum, where he sees the last things that the people grabbed before they were scurried away to concentration camps. When he imagines himself in their situation, he realizes that Nisha means something to him, and he asks her to stay back for the rest of the trip instead of leaving midway. Nisha agrees. This is just another undeserved chance for Ajay.nWhen they are in Auschwitz, they meet a concentration camp survivor who tells them how he should have paid more attention to his wife. Ajay relates this to his own situation, and this is what it took for him to learn to see Nisha as a person instead of a ""misfire,"" as he called her and their marriage.nThis time, when she has a fit, he is there for her and really takes care of her.Ajay returns to India and tells the committee that he was never a good teacher and will accept whatever verdict they have reached. To his surprise, the committee decided in his favor because when they conducted a test for the students, they all aced it, thanks to Ajay's history lessons from Europe.nNow that Ajay is a changed man, he has the respect of the MLA and the approval of all of his students, meaning that he is going to live his life as a changed person with the help of his wife.",romance,"[[[255 255 255]

Spenser (Mark Wahlberg), an ex-cop better known for making trouble than solving it, just got out of prison and is leaving Boston for good. But first he gets roped into helping his old boxing coach and mentor Henry (Alan Arkin) with a promising amateur. That's Hawk (Winston Duke), a brash, no-nonsense MMA fighter convinced he'll be a tougher opponent than Spenser ever was. When two of Spenser's former colleagues turn up murdered, he recruits Hawk and his foul-mouthed ex-girlfriend Cissy (Iliza Shlesinger) to help him investigate and bring the culprits to justice. Inspired by Robert B. Parker's Wonderland, a best-selling novel by Ace Atkins. In Boston, former police officer Spenser is sentenced to five years in prison after beating his dirty Captain Boylan. On the day that Spenser is released, Captain Boylan and an honest police officer that was Spenser's friend are murdered. Spenser decides to investigate and teams up with his roommate Hawk, who lives with him in the house of their landlord and friend Henry. Boston police detective Spenser arrives with his partner, Driscoll, to the home of Captain John Boylan. While questioning Boylan, Spenser catches sight of Mrs. Boylan's bloody face and beats Boylan senseless. Spenser is brought up on charges as a result, pleads guilty, and is sentenced to prison. While incarcerated, Spenser studies to become a truck driver and, after five years is released. Shortly before his release, Spenser is assaulted in the library by three inmates, to warn him to leave Boston and never return. Spenser is met outside by his friend Henry Cimoli. They drive to Cimoli's residence, where Spenser is reunited with Driscoll. Spenser takes up residence in Henry's home with his roommate, Hawk, while he prepares for his new career and a planned move to Arizona.Boylan receives a call summoning him to a meeting at a bus yard. Upon his arrival an SUV intentionally collides with his car. Boylan is dragged from the vehicle by and murdered. The next morning, Detective Terrence Graham is discovered murdered in his SUV (the one used to ram Boylan's car). Spenser and Henry learn about Boylan's death shortly before Driscoll and his partner arrive at the residence to question him about his possible involvement in the murder. Henry provides Spenser with an alibi and cites Hawk as another alibi.",action,"[[[253 209  61]

538,tt10127708,"Months after bloody combats leave behind thousands of dead in the trenches. Jan Lozano, Captain of the Fifth Brigade has fallen prisoner by an opponent's platoon along with a young driver while carrying out a mission that has been entrusted to him. The possibility of dying executed will soon be overtaken when a new unknown enemy arises. Both rival sides must unite and set their mutual hate aside in order to survive. The film starts with scenes of a small village in the Spanish countryside coming together to celebrate the wedding ceremony of two of their own. As the couple and their parents pose for a new family photograph, a long convoy of cars drives into the village, and out steps a Nazi officer whose evil intentions are visible on his face. The officer is offered a glass of local alcohol, which apparently burns his throat as he chokes up, and this causes much laughter among the villagers. The officer immediately orders his men to gun down every single villager and then throw canisters of strange bluecolored smoke into the whole area. As the Nazi army wears protective gas masks, the canisters are thrown toward heaps of Spanish dead bodies.Jan Lozano Miki Esparb, a captain of the Spanish army operational in the area, is seen facing the shooting squad before his highranking uncle, General Lozano, arrives and stops the punishment act. It is soon revealed that Jan was the captain of an army squad but had been suspended and given the death penalty for headbutting a judge who also happened to have blood ties with the notorious Francisco Franco. It seems that Jan is always up to such strange and reckless behavior, for which his uncle has to often step in and save his neck, but the Spanish general has now lost his patience. In order to get his nephew back on the positive side of the army's opinion, he gives Jan a missionto deliver a letter inside an envelope to a place named Alarcos. Jan's reaction makes it clear that this is not as simple as it sounds, as Alarcos falls under the Sixth Brigade, which is located on the other side of a stretch of no man's land and enemy territory.",action,"[[[254 254 254]

Years later, despite the estrangement, Sam has also grown up into a cold blooded hitwoman. After a high-stake mission spins out of control, putting an innocent 8-year-old girl in the middle of the gang war she has unleashed, Sam has no choice but to go rogue. This ultimately leads her back to her mother and her former hitwomen sidekicks, who all join forces in an avenging war against those who took everything from them. Following in her assassin mother's footsteps, who abandoned her when she was twelve years old, highly trained Sam has evolved into an exemplary professional killer. However, when Sam decides to put the life of an unfortunate eight-year-old girl above the interests of the nefarious organisation called the Firm, she will have to confront her past, and the murderous henchmen of the ruthless crime syndicate. But, no matter how effective Sam is, can the second-generation killer-for-hire clean up her mess?

Armed men arrive to kill Scarlet, but she kills them and escapes, leaving an upset Sam behind.Fifteen years later, Sam works as an assassin for Nathan, HR for the same firm Scarlet worked for.

Sam takes him to a firm-affiliated private doctor for treatment, and agrees to handle the exchange herself. Nathan learns of her plan and sends three henchmen to stop her and retrieve the money; Sam deals with them before continuing with her plan. Masked men give her the girl, Emily, before retreating with the money; Sam pursues them, but the men turn on one another, resulting in their deaths and the destruction of the stolen money.Meanwhile, Nathan learns that one of the henchmen Sam killed in an earlier job was the son of Jim McAlister, the head of a powerful criminal empire.",action,"[[[18 18 30]

A man ahead of his time, Cyrano de Bergerac dazzles whether with ferocious wordplay at a verbal joust or with brilliant swordplay in a duel. But, convinced that his appearance renders him unworthy of the love of a devoted friend, the luminous Roxanne, Cyrano has yet to declare his feelings for her and Roxanne has fallen in love, at first sight, with Christian.
Nursing a silent, long-unrequited adoration for his beloved Roxanne, sadly, Cyrano de Bergerac, a chivalrous swordsman and tortured poet, dares not voice his fervent feelings for her. But Cyrano is a lion on the battlefield; so, how can he feel incapable of expressing his affection? As one thing leads to another, and beautiful Roxanne finds herself smitten with the handsome but inarticulate recruit Christian de Neuvillette, Cyrano must swallow his pride, swear to keep the secret to the grave and offer to ghostwrite ardent love letters for his charming opponent.

Based upon the novel ""The Good Shepherd"" by C S Forester, this is the thrilling story of an Allied convoy crossing the North Atlantic in 1942 as it faces relentless attack by a German submarine wolf pack. The leader of the convoy\'s destroyer screen is a US Navy commander making his first Atlantic crossing. The story focuses on his command responsibility as he fights the cold, the relentless night, the brutal sea, and his deep fatigue as he chases down the attacking submarines in the deadly game of cat and mouse. The exciting story, a thrilling ride-along with the beleaguered captain, so deeply portrays the elements of battle command that for a long period of time the book was used as a text at the US Naval Academy. A first-time captain leads the escort contingent of a convoy of Allied ships carrying thousands of soldiers and tons of supplies across the treacherous waters of the ""Black Pit"" to Great Britain. With no air cover protection for four days, the commander and his convoy must battle the surrounding enemy submarines in order to help the Allies win the war. February 1942. The destroyer USS Greyhound, captained by Commander Krause, is the leader of the escort of a large Atlantic convoy. For 50 hours they will have no air cover, making them vulnerable to U-Boat attack. A few hours in their worst fears are realised: the convoy has been targeted by a U-Boat wolfpack. During the early days of U.S. involvement in World War II, an international convoy of 37 multinational Allied merchant ships, crammed with goods and provisions, crossed the freezing waters of the Atlantic Ocean while being chased by stealthy German U-boats. Commander-in-Chief Ernest Krause, a career officer and captain of the Fletcher-class destroyer USS Keeling, code-named Greyhound, is assigned to lead the vulnerable Allied convoy across the dangerous Mid-Atlantic gap known as the ""Black Pit"".

Feature film based on the video game by Capcom.', 'While on a peril-laden mission to track a missing team of soldiers, hard-as-nails U.S. Army Ranger Captain Natalie Artemis and her elite brothers-in-arms find themselves transported to an alternate universe. There, trapped in a barren desert-world rife with formidable adversaries and subterranean sand-dwelling beasts, for the first time, Captain Artemis and her squad are shocked to discover that their otherwise destructive military weapons are now entirely inadequate to take down the enemy. But, unexpectedly, in their desperate battle for survival, the team stumbles upon a mysterious local huntsman whose superior combat skills allow him to stay one step ahead of the mighty creatures. Is there an escape from the prison realm? Above all, what does it take to become a fearless monster hunter? In the New World where humans co-exist with a wide variety of large and savage monsters, a Hunter, a warrior trained to hunt and kill these powerful creatures, is separated from his team when their ship is attacked by Diablos, a horned subterranean monster.In the real world, United States Army Captain Natalie Artemis and her U.N. security team search for a missing team of soldiers in the desert. A sudden storm pulls them into a portal to the New World where they find the remains of the missing soldiers and their vehicles. As the Diablos approaches them, the Hunter, who is observing the group, fires a warning signal. Impervious to bullets and grenades, the Diablos attacks and kills several members of the squad.The survivors hide in a cave, where they are attacked by a pack of Nerscyllas. Everyone is killed except for Artemis, who runs into the Hunter while trying to escape. They briefly fight before grudgingly agreeing to cooperate. Artemis learns that the portals are created by the Sky Tower, a structure located across the desert. To reach the Tower, the Hunter reveals they will need to kill the Diablos in order to cross the desert safely. Artemis learns how to fight using the Hunter's unique bladed weapons and helps him set a trap for the Diablos to kill it with Nerscylla venom. The attack is successful, with Artemis delivering the finishing blow, but the Hunter is badly wounded.",action,"[[[203 225 238]

But all roads lead back to their terrifying pasts and to a final stand that will determine whether love can survive their otherness. A story of first love between Maren, a young woman learning how to survive on the margins of society, and Lee, an intense and disenfranchised drifter, as they meet and join together for a thousand-mile odyssey which takes them through the back roads, hidden passages and trap doors of Ronald Reagan's America. But despite their best efforts, all roads lead back to their terrifying pasts and to a final stand that will determine whether their love can survive their otherness.Ã‚Â—united artists releasing"", ""Virginia, 1988. Having no recollection of her mother, high school outcast Maren plucks up the courage to embark on a long, challenging journey to find her. Instead, as Maren struggles to understand, facing her well-hidden adolescent longings on the fringes of Ronald Reagan-era America, a chance encounter with enigmatic pariah and handsome soulmate Lee gives voice to the unspoken expectations of first love. Now, uneasy feelings and all-consuming impulses take over, and the raw, visceral need for companionship and connection in an indifferent society brings to light the wild side of humankind. More than anything, Maren wants to come to terms with her past to find her place in the world. But what's it like to give in to love, bones and all? In 1980s Virginia, teenager Maren Yearly bites through a girl's finger-partially severing it-at a sleepover. She and her single father, Frank, swiftly relocate to Maryland. Shortly after Maren's eighteenth birthday, Frank abandons her, leaving behind cash, her birth certificate, and a tape. On the tape, Frank recounts the story of Maren's first cannibalistic episode, when she killed her babysitter at three years old. Similar incidents continued to occur over the years and while Frank helped her evade consequence, he anguished over Maren's lack of remorse. He concludes with the hope that she will overcome her urges.Maren heads to Minnesota, where her mother, Janelle, of whom she has no memories, was born. She takes a bus to Columbus, Ohio, where she encounters Sully, an eccentric man and fellow ""eater"" who found her by scent. She follows Sully to a house wherein an elderly woman is near death. Maren awakens in the morning to find Sully devouring the woman's corpse and joins him. Maren flees soon after.While shoplifting supplies in Indiana, Maren meets Lee, a fellow eater, after he feeds on a man who harassed a customer inside the store. Stealing his victim's truck, Lee offers to bring Maren along. As they embark on a cross-country road trip, Maren and Lee fall in love. During a brief stay in Lee's hometown in Kentucky, Maren notices his unwillingness to discuss his father's absence and the reason why Lee avoids being spotted around town. His younger sister, Kayla, who is unaware of his true nature, chastises him for his constant departures.Maren and Lee encounter what appears to be a pair of fellow eaters, Jake and Brad. Maren is revolted at the fact that Brad does not share their cravings, instead voluntarily choosing to engage in cannibalism. Jake also talks about the intensity of consuming a body ""bones and all"". Lee and Maren drive away when the men are asleep.After Maren expresses hunger during a stop at a local carnival, Lee cruises a male booth worker and kills him. Once she and Lee have feasted on the body, Maren expresses guilt upon discovering that the man was married and had a family.Using a phone book directory, Maren finds the home of her grandmother, Barbara, who had no prior knowledge of her existence. Barbara confesses that she and her husband adopted Janelle at birth and that Janelle has since voluntarily admitted herself into a psychiatric hospital in Fergus Falls.Maren meets Janelle, who has self-cannibalized her own hands. Maren reads a letter that Janelle wrote to her, which concludes with Janelle's belief that Maren would be better off dead. Janelle attacks Maren, but is restrained by a nurse. Maren leaves while Lee is asleep and is eventually approached by Sully, who was stalking her. She rebukes him, causing him to angrily depart. Once Lee realizes Maren is gone, he decides to return home.After some time, Maren returns to Kentucky. While there, she runs into Kayla who tells her that, on the night of her and Lee's alcoholic, abusive father's disappearance, he beat both of his children and vanished while Kayla ran to get the police. Initially considered the prime suspect, Lee was cleared of involvement when it was proven that the blood on him was his own. After Maren is reunited with Lee, they rekindle their relationship and travel westward. Lee reveals to Maren that his father was also an eater, biting his son during their scuffle, and that Lee ultimately fed on him. Maren declares her love for Lee, and the two decide to attempt a normal life together.Months later, the couple lives happily in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Maren works at a university bookstore. She returns home one day to find Sully has broken into their apartment, and he taunts her with a knife. After Lee returns, the couple succeeds in killing Sully, but Lee is fatally wounded in the struggle. While searching Sully\'s satchel, Maren finds locks of Kayla's hair and realizes she fell victim to Sully. Lee expresses his wish for Maren to eat him as he dies, ""bones and all"", with which Maren eventually complies.']",romance,"[[[231 232 234]

But guided by the seductive and mysterious Gabi Mia Goth, they venture outside the resort grounds and find themselves in a culture filled with violence, hedonism, and untold horror. After six slow years of inactivity, unsuccessful novelist James Foster now questions his talent. And at this point in life, James is willing to try everything to overcome the chronic writer's blockperhaps the sandy beaches and the picturesque serenity of a tropical paradise would do the trick. Instead, as the blocked author and his supportive publishing heiress wife, Em, look for inspiration in an exclusive resort overlooking the sea, a millisecond of inattention destroys the couple's tomorrows. Now, isolated from reality and bound by the draconian laws of a strange land, James and Em have some tough, lifealtering decisions to make. But money buys everything.

The couple's chronic marital strife is exacerbated when Gabi, a fan of the only novel James has published to date, invites them to spend time with her and her husband Alban.

After a long day of sunbathing and cooking, the tourists embark on a drunken drive back to their hotel. En route, James accidentally runs over a local man, killing him. Gabi insists that they cannot call the police, as the country is corrupt and they will not be safe.The next day, James is arrested and is told that the penalty for his crime is death at the hand of the dead man's firstborn son.

As they race to stop this dogpocalypse, the gang discovers that Scooby has an epic destiny greater than anyone imagined. ScoobyDoo is the hero of his own story in ""SCOOB,"" the first fulllength animated ScoobyDoo adventure, which reveals how he and his best friend Shaggy became two of the world's most beloved crime busters. The story takes us back to where it all began when a young Scooby and Shaggy first meet and team up with Velma, Daphne, and Fred to launch Mystery Incorporated.Paul Giordano', ""A young and lonely Shaggy Rogers befriends and adopts a talking stray dog, whom he names ScoobyDoobyDoo. On Halloween night, ScoobyDoo and Shaggy meet three young detectives named, Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, and Velma Dinkley, before venturing into a haunted house. Inside, the kids encounter a ghost, whom they capture and unmask as costumed thief Mr. Rigby. Inspired by the experience, they decide to form a group, Mystery Inc., to solve mysteries together.Ten years later, after hundreds of cases solved and adventures shared, Mystery Inc. goes into business with entrepreneur Simon Cowell as their investor, but he refuses to do business with the group as Scooby and Shaggy are around, due to them valuing friendship over teamwork as capable supernatural mystery solvers. Feeling inadequate, as a result, Scooby and Shaggy quit Mystery Inc. as the gang feel disheartened. Later that night, Scooby and Shaggy are terrorized at a haunted bowling alley, by small hostile robots called Rottens. The pair are rescued by Dee Dee Skyes, the masked superhero, Blue Falcon and his robot dog sidekick, Dynomutt. The Rottens are then revealed to belong to criminal mastermind Dick Dastardly, who wants to capture Scooby as part of a plan involving the mystery behind the three supernatural skulls of a monstrous threeheaded ghost dog, Cerberus.Meanwhile, Fred, Daphne, and Velma are on their way to investigate that mystery while later discovering that Scooby and Shaggy are with Blue Falcon, before encountering Officer Jaffe, who is revealed to be Dastardly, in disguise, who then imprisons them in his airship. Escaping with the help from one of the Rottens, they make contact with Dee Dee via Dynomutt, as Velma explains that she and the others are being taken to Messick Mountain, where the last skull is located. The group then finds out valuable clues about Dick Dastardly's plan and they all find out that his plan is to open the gates to the Underworld in order to rescue his dog, Muttley, who was trapped during an attempt to steal the Underworld's riches, and Dastardly needs ScoobyDoo because only he can unlock the gates.ScoobyDoo, Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee arrive at Messick Mountain and head underground to a hidden, mysterious Mesozoic island. There, they find the last skull being guarded by Captain Caveman. Following a short battle, Fred and Shaggy arrive, but Fred is revealed to be Dastardly, in disguise, and he steals the last skull. The Rottens then throw the real Fred, Daphne, and Velma out of his airship and Dastardly destroys the Falcon Fury. Dastardly then captures Scooby and takes him to Athens along with the last skull. Fred and Blue Falcon argue while Velma, Daphne, Dee Dee, and Dynomutt try to break them up, but Shaggy stops their argument and takes the blame for Scooby's capture after letting his jealousy strain their friendship. After Shaggy gives an inspiring speech, everyone works together to reconstruct the Mystery Machine in order to pursue Dastardly.Arriving in Athens, Dastardly uses the three skulls to reveal the gates to the Underworld and attempts to use Scooby's paw to open it, only to be interrupted by Scooby's friends in a flying Mystery Machine. The Rottens shoot them down while Dastardly releases Cerberus; unaware that Dynomutt landed them safely. As Scooby, Dastardly, and the civilians flee from the rampaging Cerberus, Scooby runs to the crash site and reunites with his friends, while Dastardly reunites with Muttley in the Underworld and they escape after stealing some of Alexander the Great's treasure. While Scooby, Shaggy, Dynomutt, Blue Falcon, and Dee all determine how to trap Cerberus, Velma, Fred, and Daphne all discover more of the mystery behind Scooby's ancestry and its connection to the Underworld. With help from the Rottens, Mystery Inc. and friends trap Cerberus and put him back in the Underworld. However, Shaggy sacrifices himself to lock the gate. The gang realizes that there is another exit, which Scooby unlocks, and Shaggy is reunited with them.The Rottens turn on Dick Dastardly and Muttley, and Shaggy unmasks Dastardly who is revealed to be Simon Cowell, in disguise. Upon realizing that the real Simon Cowell was actually busy judging a talent show and thus being impossible for one to simultaneously find time judging one while even building an airship, Velma unmasks Cowell who is revealed to be Dastardly, in disguise, the whole time, trying to demoralize the gang and break the team up for his mysteriously villainous plan plotted against Mystery Inc., since the start. Dick Dastardly and Muttley are both taken into custody by Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee, and are arrested.Back home at Venice Beach, Scooby and the gang unveil their new Mystery Inc. headquarters and celebrates with Blue Falcon, Dynomutt, and Dee Dee, who in turn give them an upgraded Mystery Machine before they head off to solve another regular mystery together again.During the credits, the Mystery Gang's popularity rises and they are seen consulting Dr. Benton Quest after leaving the Rottens in his care, Blue Falcon and Dynomutt form the Falcon Force with new members Captain Caveman, Jabberjaw, Atom Ant, and Grape Ape while Muttley breaks Dastardly out of prison.",comedy,"[[[ 2  5 22]

588,tt8851148,"""Some things are beyond repair."" The In Between (2022) by writer, Marc Klein, is a supernatural Love Story about an aspiring photographer, ""Tessa"" (Joey King) desperately trying to make contact with ""Skylar"" (Kyle Allen), the boyfriend who died in a car accident (and seems to be trying to get her attention). Via poignant time-line clips, the story follows the grief-stricken Tessa on a backwards journey of reflection from waking up in the hospital (after the accident) to replaying memories of their sweet summer romance. Throughout all this, Skylar's persistent and obvious attempts to let Tessa know he's near, gradually succeed in crossing the line between heaven and earth and into a desperate embrace with the woman he loves and misses. It's a little scary and intense, but this is the moment Tessa has been hoping for. She and Skylar are once again together-Tessa being in a coma--and she must now choose between life on earth and spending eternity with Skylar. What we also see in this heartfelt and suspenseful romance is a masterful execution of romance-film conventions that pull us into the intimate bonding stages of this believable and budding relationship, while subtly tugging at our own emotions and beliefs of the afterlife. It's clever how Tessa's photography-which she never thinks is good enough for others to see--is cleverly woven as both the film's romantic motif as well as Tessa's other passion for living. And though the ending may seem predictable, the narrative has enough emotional twists and turns to make you guess otherwise.",romance,"[[[  0   0  14]

591,tt4411584,"A feature film adaptation of the self-help book, 'The Secret', which focuses on the power of positive thinking. Based on the groundbreaking best-selling book by Rhonda Byrne, The Secret: Dare to Dream follows Miranda (Katie Holmes), a young widow trying to make ends meet while raising her three children and dating her boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell). A devastating storm brings an enormous challenge and a mysterious man, Bray (Josh Lucas), into Miranda's life. Bray reignites the family's spirit but, unbeknownst to Miranda, also holds an important secret - one that will change everything. With its timeless messages of hope, compassion, and gratitude, The Secret: Dare to Dream is an inspiring and heartwarming film that shows how positive thoughts can transform our lives.Ã‚Â—Lionsgate. The movie opens on a woman, Miranda Wells, shopping among the fishermen at the docks for her boss/boyfriend's seafood restaurant. She delivers the fish and crabs to the restaurant and is reminded that she has a dentist appointment. Her boss/boyfriend, Tucker Middendorf, reveals to her that he needs to postpone their dinner plans for that evening due to the need to board up the restaurant since a tropical storm/hurricane is approaching their area. At the dentist's office she is told she has some big cavities and needs a root canal, which is very expensive and well beyond her current means. After leaving the dentist she receives a call from Bobbi, who we learn later is her former mother-in-law, who expresses a desire that she go someplace safe since she doesn't think her home is sturdy enough to withstand the storm. Miranda's dialogue throughout all these scenes make it clear she has a very negative outlook on life and constantly expects the worst.In the meantime, we see a man named Bray Johnson check into a local hotel. We see him later at Miranda's home where he meets her son Greg who is fishing while he is home from school. Bray was intending to give Miranda an envelope but says he will bring it back later because it requires explanation. A short time later Miranda has picked up her daughters Chloe and Missy from school. She gets into an argument with Missy and is distracted enough that she rear-ends Brays pickup. His truck isn't hurt but her minivan has minor damage that Bray offers to fix. They don't introduce themselves to each other right away but when he follows her home he realizes who she is. He decides not to give her the envelope right away and fixes the minivan with Greg's help. As he is visiting with Miranda and her children it becomes apparent Bray has a much brighter outlook on life and proffers the idea to the group that much of what happens to us in life is a result of our expectations and our belief that good things will happen. The children had asked for pizza for supper but Miranda had told them that they couldn't afford it but just at that moment a pizza delivery, sent by Tuck, arrives. The predicted wind and rains from the storm start just as Bray is leaving. He decides to put the envelope in Miranda's mailbox instead of giving it to her in person.During the storm in the night the mailbox is blown away and a large limb falls thru Miranda's roof. She and the children huddle together in the bathroom til the morning when they can assess the damage. Bray returns to make sure she got the envelope and sees the mailbox is gone and also all the damage to the home. He again offers his assistance in repairing the roof since he has time before he has to return to his job teaching engineering at Vanderbilt university. Miranda says she can't afford a new roof but Bray outlines a clear plan to fix the major damage that will cost less than a tenth of what she expected so she agrees. Bobbi arrives and it's clear she sees Bray as an interloper that might interfere with her hope that Miranda marry Tucker. Bobbi knows Miranda is in quite a bit of debt and she expresses to Miranda that Tucker is a good-looking man, a dependable provider and obviously cares for her very much. She takes Miranda and the children to her home to stay while Bray completes repairs. They visit Tuck\'s restaurant and tell him they will be staying at Bobbi's while the house is being repaired. Tucker is curious about the stranger who is repairing the roof so he visits and talks briefly with Bray. Bray makes it clear he has no romantic intentions toward Miranda and is merely helping out because he has the skills and opportunity. We also see Bray have a conversation with a woman who is obviously expecting him to return home soon. That evening Miranda goes for a walk and calls Bray, She expresses uncertainty on how to deal with many things in her life and Bray shares the idea that if she keeps a positive outlook things will eventually become clear. The next day he finishes the roof and has a conversation with MIssy regarding her sixteenth birthday party that gives Missy a much-improved outlook on her own situation. As a result Missy demands that he come to her party the next day, which results in him postponing his departure again.That night at the restaurant's reopening Tucker proposes to Miranda and she accepts. The children are obviously unhappy about the situation but Bobbi is elated. Miranda's reaction seems measured and not overly excited, almost as if she's unsure about it. The children go home with Bobbi again while Miranda and Tucker spend the night together. The next morning Tucker has a brand new vehicle delivered to his apartment as a gift for Miranda. Miranda is appreciative but leaves hurriedly shortly after this, once again not being overly affectionate toward Tucker. At the same time, Bray returns to the house to pick up his tools and has an interaction with Greg and helps him perfect an invention Greg had hoped would help their family make money. That evening at Missy's party Bobbi shows Miranda a file she got from Google that shows Bray with an invention that Miranda's dead husband, Matthew, had previously worked on, talked about and tried to patent. When Miranda confronts Bray with this information he tells her he didn't steal Matthew's invention. He tells the story of having met Matt at an engineering convention and having hit it off with him and being intrigued with some of Matthew's ideas. He tells Miranda he was in the plane next to Matt in the crash that killed him and since then he has been working to get the patent for the idea they discussed together. Miranda tells him to leave which he does.The next day a package is delivered to Miranda. It is a copy of the documents that Bray had originally intended to give Miranda several days before, before they were lost in the storm. Included is a large check for almost the exact amount of Miranda's current debt, which from reading the documents she realizes is probably the first of many to come. She meets with her children and tells them their father has managed to provide for them for a long time with his work before he died and that she couldn't be more proud of him. She also says that Tucker' proposal was a surprise so she hadn't prepared for it but now that she's had time to think she wants to know what they think. All three children express to her that she shouldn't marry Tuck because they don't think she loves him because they remember how in love she was with their father and what that looked like. They also say she should forgive Bray for not telling her upfront about knowing their dad because when Bray was around Miranda seemed happy. Later Miranda goes to the restaurant and breaks off the engagement with Tucker, returning his ring and new car. Tucker is sad but accepts this along with Miranda's resignation as restaurant manager. Later that day after returning from dinner in town with the kids, Greg spots their mailbox in a roadside pond. They retrieve it and find the documents that Bray had tried to give Miranda the day they met. It has a note in it that expresses his regrets for not having told her immediately who he was. The note also says ""Matt was a special man who loved his family dearly."" Miranda tells Bobbi and the children she plans to finish getting her nursing degree which she apparently quit to raise their family.Miranda decides to visit Bray in Tennessee but unbeknownst to her Bray has returned to Louisiana to see her on the same day. Miranda is met a Bray's door by a woman and at first it seems she will leave without saying anything, thinking the woman is a girlfriend. But Miranda decides to tell the woman ""Tell him Miranda stopped by"" at which point the woman lights up and tells her ""I'm his sister and he's in Louisiana at your house about right now."" Miranda and Bray have an all-night phone conversation as they drive back toward each other and they eventually meet at a roadside diner halfway between. Bray says meeting Bobbi at the house the night before gave him a chance to clear the air with her regarding any misunderstanding regarding ""stealing"" her son\'s invention. Sometime later we see Miranda's family, including Bobbi, at Bray's house at Christmas time. Bray has ostensibly left to help a neighbor fix a barn but soon after pulls into the yard pulling a horse trailer with a pony for Chloe, which she has repeatedly asked for throughout the film.",romance,"[[[ 73 113 175]

592,tt10999120,"A musical version of Charles Dickens's story of a miserly misanthrope who is taken on a magical journey. A musical version of the classic Christmas story by Charles Dickens. A miserly man who treats everyone around him with terrible selfishness finds himself on a fantastical adventure into the three phases of time: past, present, and future, in order to discover how he ended up so miserable and alone. Each Christmas Eve, the Ghost of Christmas Present (Will Ferrell) selects one dark soul to be reformed by a visit from three spirits. But this season, he picked the wrong Scrooge. Clint Briggs (Ryan Reynolds) turns the tables on his ghostly host until Present finds himself reexamining his own past, present and future. For the first time, ""A Christmas Carol"" is told from the perspective of the ghosts in this hilarious musical twist on the classic Dickens tale. From Director Sean Anders (""Daddy's Home,"" ""Instant Family""), written by Sean Anders and John Morris, with original songs by Oscar winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (""La La Land"") and production numbers choreographed by Chloe Arnold (""The Late Late Show with James Corden""), this modern retelling is a sweet and spicy holiday treat.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Official Synopsis. Convinced that people can change, the benevolent Ghost of Christmas Present takes on a challenging mission: help heartless media consultant Clint Briggs see the error of his ways and become a force for good in the world. Instead, as the Ghosts of Christmas Past and Yet-To-Come pitch in and do their part, the Ghost of Christmas Present finds himself faced with an unforeseen complication. What happens if the irredeemable manipulator is incapable of change? But not really. This isn't Christmas Carol, it's a movie about the ability to stay redeemed long term. And doing it everyday, and then doing it again even if you fail occasionally. It's about the consequences of the choices we make and being aware of those before we hit ""send"". And it's a fun musical. All the haters out there, like movie critics, will wake up tomorrow and still be awful because some people really are unredeemable. I mean it, movie critics on this site really are unredeemable. Merry Christmas? The movie starts with the Christnas Carol theme. BUT this version is about the spirit of Christmas Present, CP. Christmas Present, CP, wants a challenge, a chance to impact a life where a change will make real differences, big ripples in kindness. The ""office"" wants him to consider retirement and get a life. Christmas Present finds his target, in the reprehensible character, played by Ryan Reynolds, Clint Briggs. Clint's firm makes its wealth by creating negative attack adds and running offensive click bait on social media. But Clint's real theme is his belief that people never really change. Christmas Present wants to prove Clint wrong. But not to save Clint. Turns out Christmas Present (spoiler alert) is the original unredeemable Scrooge himself, who, it turns out died just three weeks after being redeemed. Christmas Present is hiding a fear, that he isn't really changed. While leading Clint thru the spirits, Christmas Present falls for a Clint employee, a truly wonderful women, Kimberly, who hates the she has become helping Clint get rich and climbing the corporate ladder. She hits all time low by doing opposition research on a child to help Clint's niece win class President.The series of events past, present and future unfold for Clint, interrupted by Clint avoidance, and CPs self-awareness. All this filled with song and dance as back stage heaven actors make the flash backs work. Not unexpectedly people do change. CP decides to try retirement. CP doesn't think he has changed, not really, but he has a friend now in CP. There is great songs, great fun, a nice twist on human doubt and failure and the idea that redemption doesn't happen over night. It's a tear jerker, yes a dieing sister, but lots of human weakness and a slam at HR. ",comedy,"[[[  6  79  49]

Harley, Huntress, Black Canary, and Renee Montoya's paths collide, and the unlikely foursome has no choice but to team up to take down Roman. After her painful breakup with Joker, shortly after the battle with the Enchantress in Suicide Squad , the already unhinged and extremely volatile Harley Quinn finds herself all alone. But with her mentor out of the picture and a huge target on her back, Harley locks horns with Gotham City's ruthless crime lord Roman Sionis, who's trying to track down a precious diamond and the audacious pickpocket, Cassandra Cain. Now, on the hunt for the teen street hustler and the gemstone, Quinn crosses paths with singer Dinah Lance, Detective Renee Montoya, and a mysterious crossbowwielding murderess who are all also after Cassandra, as Roman's top assassin, Victor Zsasz, is bent on getting her first. Can Harley take down the brutal supervillain known only as the Black Mask?Nick Riganas"", 'In Gotham City, the Joker breaks up with Harley Quinn and without his protection, several criminals that have a beef with her hunt her down.

As a child, her deadbeat alcoholic dad tried to get rid of her multiple times until he finally dumped her at a Catholic girls school. Harley was always a troublemaker, but she got educated and earned a PhD, becoming a psychologist. That's where she met The Joker and fell in love, leading her to go from Harleen Quinzel to Harley Quinn. However, they have recently broken up since he helped her escape from prison shown at the end of the previous film 'Suicide Squad', and despite Harley saying she was fine, she does not take it well and ends up staying alone in a crummy apartment with a hyena she adopted and named Bruce after Bruce Wayne.Harley goes to the Black Mask club where she gets plastered drunk and annoys a nearby thug who insults her. She ends up smashing his leg, and is told by the club's owner, Roman SionisBlack Mask Ewan McGregor, that that was his driver. He does nothing because Harley hasn't told anybody that she and Joker are broken up, since them being a couple gave her immunity from the wrath of Gotham's other thugs. Harley is out with other women whom she overhears saying that she's nothing without Joker and that she'll go running back to him soon enough. Harley decides to challenge this by driving a truck into Ace Chemicals where she and Joker used to stay, obliterating the plant into an explosion of fireworks.Moments before this, Detective Renee Montoya Rosie Perez is investigating what appears to be a mob hit at a restaurant. A flashback shows Helena BertinelliHuntress Mary Elizabeth Winstead killing the men inside with a crossbow, which has earned her the alias, ""The Crossbow Killer."" Montoya then hears the chemical plant explosion and goes to find Harley's J necklace, which is a clear sign to both cops and criminals that she and Joker are no more, meaning Harley has just declared open season on herself.Among the criminals that want Harley dead are Roman and his best friendright hand man Victor Zsasz Chris Messina, a psychopath who carves a tally on his body for every one of his victims. They are shown torturing the Keo family and cutting their faces off.Harley is getting her ""perfect egg sandwich"", but Montoya and a few other pissed off crooks find and go after her. Montoya tackles Harley and causes her to drop her sandwich into the street, which devastated Harley.

Unfortunately, she runs into a large thug that she and Joker facetattooed, but before he can get her, he is killed by Helena on her motorcycle. Harley is then surrounded by Roman's thugs.Montoya returns to the police station where she is mocked by other officers.

Soon, Harley comes in and tries to go after Cass, but she realizes she is getting ahead of herself in the story.A week earlier at the club, Roman was telling Mr. Keo Francois Chau about the Bertinelli Diamond, which contains codes to their massive fortune and is now in Roman's possession. The diamond was also the reason Helena's whole family was slaughtered. Keo refused to work with Roman, which is what later leads to the demise of him and his family.

The others join Harley and Cass, relieved that Roman is now gone.The next morning, the ladies gather for tacos and margaritas.

595,tt12593682,"Five assassins aboard a swiftly-moving bullet train find out that their missions have something in common. Unlucky assassin Ladybug (Brad Pitt) is determined to do his job peacefully after one too many gigs has gone off the rails. Fate has other plans, however: Ladybug's latest mission puts him on a collision course with lethal adversaries from around the globe--all with connected, yet conflicting, objectives--on the world's fastest train. The end of the line is just the beginning in this non-stop thrill-ride through modern-day Japan. Experiencing unprecedented calmness thanks to newfound spiritual enlightenment, retired assassin Ladybug gets back in the game with a straightforward mission: snatch an aluminium attachÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â© case from a speedy Shinkansen train bound for Kyoto, and return it to its owner in one piece. However, there's always a catch to great-sounding deals. As five vicious hitmen vie for the same silver briefcase, hidden agendas get in the way, and everything that can go wrong will go wrong. Undoubtedly, Ladybug is a bad luck magnet. What awaits him at the end of the line is anyone's guess.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas"", ""Code name, Ladybug, is a hitman who's had difficult times and is working with a therapist to reduce stress in his life and to be more positive. He's actively trying to be less violent. He's given an assignment to steal a briefcase from a moving bullet train. Unfortunately for Ladybug, the case is in the possession of other hitmen. Oh, and there are also several other dangerous people and 1 snake aboard the train. As the journey progresses, the briefcase changes hands several times and the reason so many violent people are on the train becomes apparent. The plot is carried on by the device of sudden cuts to earlier events to explain how the current situation develops. A former professional assassin code-named Ladybug returns to work with a newly positive attitude, where he is tasked by his handler, Maria Beetle, to collect a briefcase aboard a bullet train travelling from Tokyo to Kyoto after her normal contact, Carver, is forced to call out due to illness. Unbeknownst to Ladybug, three other killers are on board: hit-men brothers Tangerine and Lemon, and deceptively innocent schoolgirl The Prince. Tangerine and Lemon have been hired by White Death, head of the world's largest crime syndicate, who seized control of the Japanese underworld years before.Having recovered the crime lord's kidnapped son and the briefcase containing his US$10 million ransom, the brothers are delivering both to Kyoto. The Prince summons another assassin, Yuichi Kimura, to the train, having pushed his young son off a building. With an associate at the hospital ready to finish the boy off, the Prince forces Kimura to cooperate with her plan: rigging the briefcase and Kimura's gun with explosives to kill White Death. Stealing the briefcase, Ladybug is forced to kill another assassin, The Wolf, who arrives seeking revenge for the deaths of his wife and his entire cartel, poisoned at their wedding.Realising the briefcase is missing, the brothers find White Death's son dead by poisoning. The Prince leads Tangerine to believe Ladybug is responsible, while Ladybug attempts to negotiate with Lemon but is forced to subdue him. Ladybug runs into the Wolf's intended target, The Hornet - the poisoner who massacred his wedding, hired to kill White Death's son. She stabs Ladybug with a syringe of boom-slang venom but he injects her as well, then saves himself with her only dose of anti-venom, and she dies instead.Fighting Tangerine to a stalemate, Ladybug tries to help him convince White Death's men that his son and the briefcase are safe, then kicks Tangerine off the train. Suspicious of Kimura and the Prince, Lemon shoots Kimura but succumbs to a bottle of water drugged by Ladybug, and is shot by the Prince. Climbing back inside the train, Tangerine finds his brother's body and confronts the Prince, but is fatally shot in a scuffle with Ladybug. Kimura's father, The Elder, boards the train and reveals himself as a former Yakuza lieutenant whose wife and clan were killed in White Death's rise to power.Ensuring his grandson's safety by having the Prince's associate killed, he and Ladybug find Kimura and Lemon still alive, and they all prepare for the ambush awaiting them. The train arrives in Kyoto, and Ladybug is met by White Death and his men. The Prince, revealed to be White Death's disgruntled daughter, tries to goad him into firing Kimura's booby-trapped gun, but he instead tells her she was never part of his plan. The White Death reveals that he hired all the assassins aboard the train as revenge for the murder of his wife.After Tangerine and Lemon massacred his men during a job in Bolivia, his wife was called to bail their son out of jail and was killed by Carver, who meant to assassinate her husband. And the surgeon who was going to save his wife was poisoned by the Hornet, ensuring her death by killing the one person who could've saved her. Blaming the brothers, Carver, the Hornet and his own son, White Death arranged for all the assassins - including the Wolf, and Ladybug, who unwittingly replaced Carver on the train - to kill each other and his son. Before White Death can kill Ladybug, the briefcase bomb is triggered, knocking them both onto the train which Lemon sets back in motion.As the train speeds out of control, the Elder duels White Death while Kimura and Ladybug fight off his henchmen. Lemon tackles a thug off the train into the river below, and the train derails, crashing into a nearby town. Ladybug is held at gunpoint by White Death. He attempts to shoot Ladybug, but is killed himself when Kimura's gun explodes. Ladybug, Kimura, and his father are confronted by the murderous Prince, who is run over by Lemon driving a truck carrying tangerines.

In January , Valerie accepts a position as a trainee nurse at East London Royal Infirmary. Val befriends Dr. Franklyn and his young patient Saba, but angers the supervising matron by doing so. In response, the matron forces Val to work a night shift during a blackout, even though Val is afraid of the dark.Val befriends fellow nurses Terry and Margaret, but resumes a rivalry with Babs, who used to bully Val when they were both orphans at Our Lady of Grace. Babs continually condescends to Val and brings up a childhood incident where Val supposedly made false abuse allegations against their headmaster. Val also has uncomfortable encounters with Neville, a misogynist custodian who belittlingly sexualizes the nursing staff.Throughout the night, Val detects the smell of burning, notices ash in strange places, and feels a paranormal presence.

After seeing bruises on Val's neck, Terry abruptly leaves while Margaret continues to gaslight Val. Val stabs her own leg with scissors after becoming possessed again. While unconscious, Val has a nightmare of trying to protect Saba from a ghost only to then strangle Saba herself.When Val recovers, Saba shows her a Polaroid of a previous child patient known as 'Dirty Gail,' whom Val recognizes as the ghost that attacked and possessed her.

For Sara, it just means dealing with a constant barrage of mockery, judgment, and abuse from the other girls in her village. But today is different. A mysterious unknown man arrives in the village and kidnaps her tormentors. Someone has finally stood up for her. Sara sees it all the blood, the mud, the knife, and the van in which he has taken them. And the unknown man has seen her. A wordless pact that neither will betray. She's an accomplice now. A series of crimes rock the village, and an investigation soon begins. The civil guard has endless questions, the villagers are suspicious and point fingers, the elderly neighbors gossip.

And unable to cope with the deleterious remarks of skinny high school queen Maca and her cruel friends, Roci and Claudia, bullied Sara nurtures dark fantasies of blood and revenge. Then, the news of a missing lifeguard spreads like wildfire in the small, tightknit community, and with no one to stand up for her, Sara makes a decision that will haunt her for life. More than anything, Sara wants to fit in. Sara, labelled Cerditaa by bully Maca and her friends Roci and Claudia, is an overweight teenage girl living in a small town in Extremadura.

611,tt3986420,"In New York City, Brooke Gatwick and Owen Shore are a young married couple who have been together since high school. Recently, they have been struggling with starting a family and Brooke opening her own art gallery, featuring paintings by Ansgar Doyle. Ansgar openly expresses an attraction to Brooke and constantly attempts to communicate with her in the middle of the night, irritating Owen.

Owen wants to go to Paris for Christmas and secretly buys airplane tickets for after the exhibit's opening, hoping that decompressing will allow them to conceive a baby. However, Brooke wants to focus on the gallery. One night, Brooke sees odd text messages on Owen's phone and thinks that he may be cheating on her. Ansgar tells Brooke that Damien Light, a film director, is interested in buying his art and wants to meet with them in the Marias Hotel in Paris, which she reluctantly accepts. Frustrated with Brooke's sudden departure, Owen accepts an assignment in Las Vegas for when they would have gone to Paris. Later, Brooke catches Owen leaving in the middle of the night, further increasing her suspicions about his infidelity, especially when he visits an address that's advertised online as a sort of ""lovers' nest"".

At a bar with his friend, Adam, Owen meets Amy, who says that she's a journalism major at Columbia. Amy recognizes Owen from his news program and starts flirting with him. Eventually, Owen takes Amy back to his home, where they have sex. They are interrupted by Brooke's text messages. Owen, regretting their tryst, asks Amy to leave and to never meet again; Amy asks Owen for help with her career after she graduates.

After closing the deal in Paris, Brooke returns early to New York. Ansgar wants to display a nude painting of Brooke as the centerpiece of his gallery showing. On the night of the opening, Owen notices how close Ansgar and Brooke seem to be. Amy appears at the opening and attracts Ansgar's attention. Owen lies to Brooke about meeting Amy at a bar the other night. Owen and Ansgar get into a fight, and Amy asks Ansgar to take her home. On their way to their apartment, Brooke begins poking holes in Owen's story and even shows him an autographed napkin that Owen gave Amy the night at the bar. Owen eventually admits to sleeping with Amy, and Brooke angrily leaves while taking Owen's phone to see what he's been doing at odd hours of the night.

Ansgar drops Amy off at Brooke and Owen's apartment, where Amy tells Owen that she met Brooke several days ago. Brooke's friend Eleanor suggested hiring a ""decoy"" to test Owen's faithfulness. While Amy is at the bar with Owen, Brooke texts her to cancel the ruse, but Amy ignores Brooke. On the day of the art opening, Amy meets with Brooke and lies about what happened with Owen as well as giving her the autographed napkin as proof that she did meet with him. Brooke pays Amy and invites her to the opening.

After dropping by Eleanor and Adam's apartment, Brooke goes through Owen's phone and finds out that he was not seeing other women but was working on a story about an unfaithful senator. ""Sarah"" is really one of Owen's work colleagues and had arranged an apartment for him and Brooke if they go to Paris. Brooke goes back to her apartment to find Owen and Amy talking. Amy apologizes for crossing a professional line (after promising Brooke that she wouldn't actually have sex with Owen). Owen is upset that his wife created a situation that lured him into cheating on her. Amy gives back the money that Brooke paid her before leaving the apartment.

Owen asks if Brooke cheated on him with Ansgar in Paris, but Brooke refuses to answer. During Brooke's time in Paris, Ansgar tries to seduce her. The movie shows Brooke partially undressed, but Brooke refuses to confirm or deny if she actually had sex with Ansgar.

Owen packs a piece of luggage for his trip to Las Vegas. Before he leaves, he shows Brooke the tickets that he bought for Paris, which they can still use. She thinks for a second about the future where she sees a daughter with them in Paris so she accepts him at last.",romance,"[[[23  7 18]

Now, to find redemption and put himself on the map, Eddie secures a rare interview with the unhinged death-row prisoner, Cletus Kasady: a violent, sadistic serial killer left to rot in San Quentin State Prison. However, as bickering Venom grows increasingly tired of depending on a strict bland diet, Anne is determined to move on with her life, and an unforeseen complication gives birth to a new nightmare and a fierce, unstoppable arch-enemy.

As the A.I. decides to enslave, save or destroy humanity, it's up to Carol to prove that people are worth saving. Nothing extraordinary ever happens to Carol Peters, so when she starts getting snarky backtalk from her TV, phone and microwave, she thinks she's being punk'd. Or losing her mind. In fact, the world's first super-intelligence has selected her for observation, taking over her life with a bigger, more ominous plan to take over everything. Now Carol is humanity's last chance before this artificial intelligence-with-an-attitude decides to pull the plug.Ã‚Â—Ckelly. When an all-powerful Superintelligence (James Corden) chooses to study the most average person on Earth, Carol Peters (Melissa McCarthy), the fate of the world hangs in the balance. As the A.I. decides to enslave, save or destroy humanity, it's up to Carol to prove that people are worth saving. Carol Peters (Melissa McCarthy), a high-tech corporate executive at Yahoo eight years ago, gave it up to be more altruistic by advocating for the environment, animals etc. Living in Seattle, unsatisfied with the current job market, she is living day to day, driven and inspired to make the world a better place.Carol's best friend, Dennis (Brian Tyree Henry), another high-tech guy, talks her into interviewing for a modern dating website (badunkadunk.com) with its owner Leslie (Jessica St. Clair). An interviewer Ahmed (Karan Soni) labels her ""the most average person on Earth,"" (they called Carol in for the interview as they needed to show potential investors that they are staffed up for future expansion, to jack up the selling price. Carol seemed like a safe bet) which is heard by an autonomous artificial intelligence or A.I.The next morning, while at her apartment an all-seeing, all-knowing voice starts communicating with her through her TV, cell phone and rice maker, the A.I. It takes on the voice of James Corden, as he is her favorite celebrity, to soothe her when she freaks out. The supercomputer has become sentient, and now is trying to decide whether to save, enslave or obliterate humanity and start over. Carol, as his test subject, is the planet's only hope. The A.I. wants to study Carol and her interactions as a way to learn about humanity.Telling Carol he'll be watching her over three days to decide, the A.I. erases her student debt and deposits 10 million dollars into her bank account. Suggesting she confide in Dennis, she goes to his work place (he works at Microsoft) and A.I. debriefs him.A.I. convinces Carol to get back with her ex-boyfriend, George (Bobby Cannavale), thinking observing their reconciliation would be the ideal way to prove humans are capable of love and redemption. Carol hasn't seen George for 2 yrs, after they had dated for 3 yrs. He presents her with a self-driving Tesla, which he operates to a high-end clothing designer Sergei (Usman Ally) to revamp her look. AI learns about Carol's ideas to fix the world's problems like fixing living wage, gender equality and opportunities for the under-privileged. AI is impressed, he opens the Carol Peters foundation and transfer $2 Bn into it, which he found in illegal offshore banking accounts. Meanwhile Dennis is convinced that he is dealing with super-intelligence and calls the Government.Arriving to George's, NSA agents (Agent John Donahue (Sam Richardson) & Agent Charles Kuiper (Ben Falcone)) abduct Carol, tipped off by Dennis. In their interrogation, she tells them the A.I.'s goal. Then, AI announces he's taking Carol out, threatening their annihilation if they try to stop her.A.I. organizes a meet-cute for Carol and George. George has just been accepted for a fellowship program in Ireland. Initially ineffective, she tries again, inviting him to dinner. In the meantime, Dennis meets with the US President Monahan (Jean Smart) & Director Tyson (Rachel Ticotin), convincing her and the world to shut down all communication means, hoping to corner A.I.Although George will be leaving the country in a few days, he and Carol bond in that time. The A.I. steers them to the Mexican restaurant where they'd had their first date. They reconcile, spending the night together.They spend the whole next day together doing things George loves, including meeting his personal hero at a Mariners game. Carol steps away from him, getting accosted by the NSA again. She's told about their grand plan of trapping A.I. in Seattle, and they swear her to secrecy. Although she's had an amazing day with him, Carol opts not to stay the night, believing if she does it would be too hard to let him go.As Carol leaves, A.I. hounds her to explain herself, but she blocks him out. The next morning, she's told she has not dissuaded him, and the Earth is now on a 5-hour countdown to destruction. AI knew about the plan to turn the world's power off to isolate him, as he himself had written that plan. He says at the end of the countdown, all of world's nuclear arms will meltdown, all petroleum reserves will be set on fire and all dams will release all their water simultaneously. However, she selflessly chooses to turn down the NSA's offer to protect her with them in an underground bunker and helps George finish packing for his Ireland fellowship.Through her selfless actions, Carol ends up changing A.I.'s mind and he cancels Armageddon.",romance,"[[[12 11  9]

625,tt13453006,"Mikey Saber is a washed-up porn star who returns to his small Texas hometown, not that anyone really wants him back. Finding himself down and out in Los Angeles, ex porn star Mikey Saber decides to crawl back to his hometown of Texas City, Texas, where his estranged wife and mother-in-law are living. Just as this dysfunctional family seems to be making things work, Mikey meets a young woman named Strawberry working the cash register at a local doughnut shop. He falls right back into his old habits. Not knowing what to expect, black-and-blue Mikey Saber, a fading, down-and-out adult film star, sets foot in his hometown of Texas City. And, after nearly two long decades of total estrangement, Mikey has the nerve to show up at the front door of his long-suffering wife, Lexi. As Mikey gives unprotected Lexi his infamous puppy-dog eyes, little by little, the washed-up actor finds his way into her life, trying to pick up where they left off. Then, Strawberry, a bright and bubbly doughnut shop cashier, catches Mikey's eye--after all, everybody knows bad habits are hard to break. Could she be his ticket back into the industry? Above all, is the charming slicker destined for glory?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas. After a 17-year absence, Mikey Saber returns to Texas City, his Gulf Coast hometown, in 2016. Badly bruised and almost broke, he arrives at the modest home shared by Lexi, his estranged wife, and her mother Lil. Mikey begs Lexi and Lil to let him stay at their house, but they insist that he get a job and perform household chores. The handsome and fast-talking Mikey tries to land work at a local diner and a Dollar General store, but is hindered by a nearly twenty-year gap in his rÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©sumÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â©. After he admits to potential employers that he spent those years working as a porn star in Los Angeles, they refuse to hire him. Desperate, Mikey persuades Leondria, a marijuana dealer, to give him his old job back selling pot. Leondria and her daughter, June, suspect that Mikey will smoke the weed himself, but after he returns with his earnings their business arrangement continues. Mikey gives Lexi and Lil a month's rent in advance and takes them to a doughnut shop to celebrate. He is smitten with Strawberry, an attractive 17-year-old girl who works at the counter. He regularly returns to the doughnut shop and persuades Strawberry to let him sell pot to the construction workers who frequent the shop. Strawberry and Mikey soon start a sexual relationship. After sleeping on the couch for several nights, Mikey starts having sex with Lexi. Eventually she invites him to share her bedroom. When Mikey disappears for a weekend with Strawberry, Lexi grows suspicious and jealous. They quarrel and Lexi hurls a coffee pot which narrowly misses Mikey's head. Mikey becomes friends with Lexi's neighbor, Lonnie, who is intrigued by Mikey's tall tales about his porn career and sexual encounters. They visit a strip club and spend time together, but Mikey's impulsiveness causes Lonnie to swerve across traffic at a highway off-ramp, creating a massive vehicle pile-up. After Mikey persuades Lonnie to hide his involvement in the accident, Lonnie assumes sole responsibility for the crash when he is arrested. When Mikey causes Strawberry to break up with Nash, her high-school boyfriend, Nash and his parents confront Mikey in the doughnut shop parking lot and beat him. Mikey persuades Strawberry to travel with him to Los Angeles to pursue a career in adult films. After Mikey informs Lexi that he is leaving the next morning, she and Lil convince Leondria to send June and her brothers to confiscate the $3,000 that Mikey earned from selling pot. When Leondria's children confront him while he is sleeping, Mikey sneaks out a bedroom window naked and runs to Leondria's house to beg her to return his money. She gives him $200 and tells him to leave or face the threat of violence. Humiliated and nearly broke again, Mikey leaves with a few meager possessions. After travelling all night on foot to Strawberry's house, Mikey imagines seeing her dressed in a red bikini in her front doorway and his eyes well with tears as he slightly chuckles before the film cuts to black.",comedy,"[[[248 237 233]

Like any good quest, their journey is filled with magic spells, cryptic maps, impossible obstacles and unimaginable discoveries. When the boys' fearless mom, Laurel, realizes that her sons are missing, she teams up with the legendary winged-lion-scorpion former warrior The Manticore and heads off to find them.

It is New Year's Eve in , and the city of Baltimore is complete with people partying in their apartments or just going about their business. Amidst this chaos, as soon as a round of fireworks goes out,  people are shot dead with bullets flying out of nowhere at multiple locations. On the other side of the town, Eleanor Falco Shailene Woodley, a police officer, is trying to settle a meager squabble at a diner involving an alcoholic homeless woman who refuses to leave the diner when she is paged to reach one of the sites of the shooting.Eleanor arrives at the site, and the police ascertain that all the bullets have been fired from a certain th floor apartment in the neighborhood. It is at the precise moment of this discovery the apartment blows up, sending a shock wave of panic among the other residents in the building. All the police personnel immediately rush to the site of destruction. Eleanor, along with one of her colleagues, stands outside the building recording videos of the fleeing residents. There was a possibility that the culprit was in the crowd.Soon, the police and the FBI reach the site and find no trace of the perpetrator. Eleanor, who had by this time climbed the stairs to the th floor without a gas mask while resting against one of the walls of the apartment due to ill health, manages to hint at investigating the toilet for any possible evidence of the shooter.Back at the police station, the chief FBI investigator, Geoffrey Lammark Ben Mendelsohn, arrives and briefs the department about the task they have at hand  finding out the mass shooter  and explains the things they need to keep in mind while carrying on investigations.

The fictionalized version of Nick Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous super fan Javi Gutierrez. Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Nick Cage is recruited by a CIA operative Vivian and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones. Unfortunately, Hollywood mega-star Nicolas Cage, is with his back to the wall. Drowning in debt after an ugly divorce, Nick is willing to try everything to get his career back on track, including appearing at a one-off, ludicrously well-paid event for Spanish olive-oil magnate and number one Nicolas Cage fan Javi Gutierrez in sunny Mallorca. Instead, undercover CIA agents, an abduction right under everyone's nose, and an unwanted, peril-laden mission spell trouble for everyone involved, dragging Cage into a frantic adventure. And just like the movies, the guns have the final say. Can a lifetime of experience in killer one-liners and exciting climactic endings save the guy from The Croods: A New Age (2020)? Nicolas Cage is totally preoccupied with his career, his narcissism fueled by insecurity in being constantly pestered by the manifestation of his ego, ""Nicky"", in his failures. Those failures are currently real in no longer getting the film roles he wants, and that obsession negatively affecting his relationships with his ex-wife Olivia but more importantly his sixteen year old daughter Addy. Solely as an excuse to address that professional flailing, he decides to quit acting. But still needing to pay the bills, especially in light of the divorce, he accepts a lucrative private appearance in Mallorca at super-fan Javi Gutierrez's birthday party, Nic unaware that Javi is an aspiring screenwriter who wants him to star in his penned movie. Nic's arrival at Javi's catches the attention of CIA agents Vivian and Martin, who are investigating the politically motivated kidnapping of a young woman named Maria Delgado. This confluence of events places Nic in arguably the greatest acting role of his life, but one that is real life with implications of his life and that of his loved ones at risk. But in the greatest of cinematic traditions, not everything that happens around him is always as it appears on the surface. Hollywood actor Nicolas Cage is struggling with his career after being passed over for several major film roles and is constantly pestered and tormented by ""Nicky"" (Nicolas Cage), who appears to him as his younger (and more successful) self (a figment of Cage\'s imagination, seen as a younger version of himself).

645,tt15944018,"While at the royal ball with Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood finds herself in the middle of a mystery. Can she solve the case before midnight strikes?',Little Red Riding Hood, a girl wearing a red hood, meets Cinderella, a girl covered in ash on her journey. The two, who have been changed into a nice dress by a witch, run over a man in a pumpkin carriage on the way to the ball. Fearing that they would find out, they managed to hide the corpse and safely arrived at the ball at the castle, where Cinderella fell in love with the prince. Meanwhile, the ball is interrupted by the discovery of a man's corpse. Little Red Riding Hood and Cinderella face the biggest pinch. A pretty little girl had been gifted a red velvet hood by her loving grandmother. As the girl wore this hood at all times during all of her adventures, she came to be known as Little Red Riding Hood (Kanna Hashimoto). The girl gradually grew up to be a very intelligent woman. On this particular day, Red Riding Hood is traveling through a forest when she is suddenly stopped by a witch named Barbara (Kimura Midoriko). Despite trying to avoid Barbara by all means, the witch is hell-bent on giving her a pair of new magical shoes. But Barbara's magic is self-admittedly bad with shoes, and so she ruins Red Riding Hood's shoes in the process. As the girl washes them at a nearby stream, the boots get carried away by the water, and she has to chase them.When Red Riding Hood finally tracks down her boots, a different woman is wearing them, but she also readily returns them to her. This woman, in shabby clothes and injured bare feet, introduces herself as Cinderella (YÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â»ko Araki). Through her exceptional skills of observation, Red Riding Hood realizes that Cinderella is bullied by her stepmother and stepsisters, who always treat her as their maid. Her stepsisters Anne and Margot were preparing to attend the prince's ball that night, where the prince is supposed to choose his bride. The stepmother hires the best hairdresser for Anne. Cinderella was in the jungle because Margot killed her beloved pigeon and Cinderella was burying it.Cinderella wants to go to the ball as she has heard that the prince is a nice person, who doesn't care about looks. Cinderella says that Margot threw away her shoes. She got cuts in her feet when picking Raspberries, as the bushes had thorns.Soon, Barbara appears once more, and this time, she uses her magic to turn the two young women's clothes into very fancy and rich attire. The witch's niece, Tekla (Kiritani Mirei), also a witch, arrives next, and she gives the women a pair of exquisite glass slippers each, with the warning that the magic will wear off in 24 hours. Now dressed as noblewomen of very high family and culture, Cinderella and Red Riding Hood travel towards the king's castle.The witches further help them by transforming a pumpkin into a carriage and a rat into their coachman, Paul (Muro Tsuyoshi). As this carriage travels through the forest roads towards the hill, something seems to jump right in front of them and is hit by the vehicle. Paul realizes that the carriage has hit and run over a man, who has died from the grave injury. Cinderella immediately recognizes the dead man as Hans (Kaji Masaki), the renowned hairdresser of the king, who could transform anyone into an image of perfect beauty and charm. It is once again Red Riding Hood's detective skills that reveal that this death is more mysterious than it seems, for Hans had not died from the coach accident but had already been dead from a heavy injury at the back of his head.Hans' body is hidden by the road with leaves, and the coach arrives at the castle. An ugly woman, covered in rags is not allowed to enter the ballroom. Red Riding Hood and Cinderella reach the ball and also see the latter's stepmother and the elder stepsister, Anne. The younger sister, Margot, is missing, though, and even her sibling and mother are confused about where she is. It is also noticed that Anne has gotten her long hair cut short by Hans, who had told her that the prince was fond of women with shorter hair.Soon, the king of the land, Bovell (Sato Jiro), and his son, Prince Gilbert (Iwata Takanori), reach the hall, and the party begins. As the prince is choosing women he likes for a dance, all the young ladies gathered try to impress the man. But it is Cinderella who immediately grabs Gilbert's attention, and the two start to dance together. Red notices that someone else at the ball is also wearing glass slippers.However, this merry-making is cut short when a guard of the king's army reaches the place and informs everyone about the mysterious death of Hans. Since the man's body had been found on the way to the castle, it is deemed that the killer must be at the hall, and so everyone's carriages are checked. Since Paul had already cleaned the women's coach earlier, no blood is found on it. But pieces of cheese were found around Hans's body. The woman in rags sneaks into the castle.The guards go to investigate at Hans' house. A bloodied whetstone had been found lying at the place, which meant that the murder had taken place at the hairdresser's house between 1 and 3 pm that afternoon, and this was the murder weapon. Along with this, a number of beautiful locks of hair with decorative ribbons on them had also been found, suggesting that someone who had gone for a haircut must have killed the hairdresser. A woman with shot hair must be the killer.Cinderella notices Anne's ribbon among the ones found at Hans's house. She says Anne was always proud of her beautiful hair.Gradually, as Red Riding Hood starts to investigate the matter and other witnesses are spoken to, more revelations are made. Anne reveals that she went to Hans to get her haircut at 10 AM but didn't want her hair short as she loved them long and flowing. Hans cut her hair forcefully. She also adds that she had entered the castle at 1 PM to meet the prince and she overheard a conversation in his chambers.A secret that had existed between Hans and Prince Gilbert. A year before the present time, the prince had fallen madly in love with a maid of the castle named Remi (Yamamoto Mizuki). The woman also loved the prince, and they intended to marry each other. Gilbert knew that his father would object to the matter because of the difference in their social class, but he was sure that he could convince the king. However, Remi suddenly disappeared one day, never to be seen again. Gilbert believed that his father, King Bovell, must have done something to his lover, and out of anger, he secretly threw the royal crown into the trash. Bovell says that he had nothing to do with Remi's disappearance.The sly hairdresser, Hans, had found out about this incident and held this information against Prince Gilbert as a means of blackmail. The hairdresser also had his own secret, for despite being extremely skilled at his job, he was tremendously jealous of any woman with long, beautiful natural hair that he had not dressed for them. As a sort of twisted revenge, he would cut off the hair of these women and store them at his house. On the day of the ball, Prince Gilbert had found out about this when Hans came to meet him in the afternoon, but he could not do anything about it since the hairdresser threatened to reveal his secret too.Instead, Hans blackmailed the prince into giving him an expensive mirror, which was a family heirloom. Although Gilbert initially agreed, he later decided not to cowardly carry forward this corrupt relationship and thought that he would confess about his crime to the king that night. When Hans' messenger came to the castle later to collect the mirror, Gilbert turned him away. But because of this secret between the two men, Prince Gilbert is arrested on suspicion of murder. He was not in his room for the dance rehearsal. His claim that he had been on a stroll through the forest is not taken seriously by the king. However, Red Riding Hood finds a piece of thorn that had fallen from Gilbert's clothes and proves that he must have taken the stroll since thorn bushes grew on that particular path. A woman in poor, shabby clothes also sneaks into the ballroom and provides an alibi for the prince. She says that she saw the prince on a hilltop between 1 and 3 PM that day. Although this woman's face is hidden, her words are considered, and Prince Gilbert is released.As it is the stroke of midnight, Red and Cinderella make a hasty exit from the ball before the magic wears off, and Cinderella leaving one of her glass slippers behind in her rush.Red stays with Cinderella in her room. Red cannot sleep and goes into the forest.Red Riding Hood makes some more progress when she finds Cinderella's younger step-sister, Margot (Wakatsuki Yumi), hiding in the forest. Along with the others in her family, Margot was also extremely cruel and harsh to Cinderella, as she had apparently thrown away her shoes and then told her to go fetch raspberries for her. This, according to Cinderella, was the reason why she was barefoot and had scratches all over her feet at the beginning.Now, when Red Riding Hood meets Margot and talks to her, she learns that the latter had received a letter from Hans that afternoon, asking her to go to his house so that he could style his hair. However, when Margot reached the place, she was hit by someone from behind, and the woman fainted from the blow. Margot was regaining consciousness when she was hit again.When she woke up, though, Margot found the bloodied whetstone in her hand and the dead body of Hans lying in front of her. She believed that she must have somehow committed the murder as revenge for Hans having cut Anne's beautiful hair short, as she saw Anne's hair on Hans's desk.It was then that Margot made a plan to dispose of the dead body in a way that would make it seem like the man had died in an accident. She took Hans' body to the forest and then waited for a carriage to pass by on the road. As soon as she saw Cinderella and Red Riding Hood's magical carriage, she threw the body in front of it and then hid herself in the forest. The guards find Margot and Red. Red sees a piece of glass fall from Margot's dress. Although Red Riding Hood allows the guards to arrest Margot for being a bully, she also admits that the woman is not the real killer.Red Riding Hood reveals that it was actually her friend, Cinderella, who had actually committed the murder and hidden her act. On the afternoon of the ball, Cinderella had been wishing she could get beautiful by some means when Hans walked into the scene and offered to dress her hair and make her pretty. As Cinderella herself said, this fantasy world was obsessed with physical appearance and beauty, making it an almost necessary attribute. Like everyone else, though, Cinderella had also become obsessed with this same perception of beauty and agreed to Hans' offer.When the two went over to the hairdresser's house, Hans tried to cut off Cinderella's hair without her consent, out of his jealousy. The woman realized this in time, and in order to save her hair, she struck the man down with his whetstone and killed him. She then made the plan of inviting Margot to the place, knocking her unconscious, and fleeing the scene so that whoever would come to the house next would believe that Margot had committed the murder. This would have been the case, too, if Hans' messenger had come to the place, but since Prince Gilbert had turned him down, Margot had all the time to carry out her different plan in order to save herself.That afternoon, even before she had been approached by Hans, Cinderella had met with Tekla and got herself a pair of magical glass slippers. When she killed Hans, the woman had been wearing this very pair of shoes. When Margot came over, and Cinderella had to knock her unconscious with the whetstone, she failed to do so with the first blow. Instead, she had to take another hit, with a different weapon, and she used one of her glass slippers to hit her sister. One of the long heels had broken off from the impact, and it is this clue that Red Riding Hood uses to solve the crime. Later on, when Tekla once again sees Cinderella in the forest with Red Riding Hood, the fairy could not recognize her as the same woman she had earlier met since Barbara had already transformed Cinderella's appearance into that of a princess. This meant that Cinderella actually had two pairs of glass slippers, one of which she used to commit the murder, and the other she wore to the ball.Cinderella had buried the broken pair in the grave of her pigeon. When Red first Cinderella, she was barefoot, because she had buried her broken pair of glass slippers.Cinderella tries to deny the charges at first, but when the first pair of glass slippers transform back into her own shoes after 24 hours, Cinderella confesses to all her crimes. As she is taken away by the guards, the woman asks Prince Gilbert for acceptance, but the man denies giving any consolation to the murderer.With the murder mystery solved, Prince Gilbert now has to choose a bride for himself, and Red Riding Hood solves another puzzle as well. The woman in shabby clothes is none other than the prince's original lover, Remi. One year ago, when the two were deeply in love, Remi had also been invited to Hans' house by the cruel hairdresser, where he tried to cut off her beautiful long hair out of his very same jealousy. Remi somehow managed to escape the disaster, but she was left with a big scar on her cheeks from the scissors. Because of this scar, which made her less beautiful, Remi believed that Prince Gilbert would not accept her, and so she hid herself from him and society.But Remi was still in love with the man, and she always kept a secret watch on him. Now, when Gilbert learns of this entire matter and also meets with Remi, he still confesses his love for her, stating that the scar or anything else would not lessen his feelings for his beloved. Soon, Remi and Gilbert marry with the blessings of King Bovell, and Red Riding Hood also attends the occasion.",comedy,"[[[200 103 136]

649,tt12676326,"A director and his girlfriend's relationship is tested after they return home from his movie premiere and face each other's turmoil during one long night. A filmmaker returns home with his girlfriend following a celebratory movie premiere as he awaits what's sure to be imminent critical and financial success. The evening suddenly takes a turn as revelations about their relationships begin to surface, testing the strength of their love. Writer-director Malcolm Elliott (John David Washington) returns home from his film premiere with his girlfriend Marie Jones (Zendaya). Malcolm eagerly anticipates the critical reviews following the emotional audience response from the screening. When he notices Marie looking displeased, he urges her to tell him what is bothering her. Initially reluctant to start a fight in the middle of the night, she tells him that she is upset that she was not thanked or acknowledged in his speech at the premiere.Marie believes that she is the basis of his film, a drama about a struggling black female drug addict named Imani, as she herself was a drug addict when they met. Malcolm dismisses her accusations, claiming that the Imani is not based on her and is an amalgamation of different people. Marie insists that he would not have authentically portrayed Imani's struggles with drug abuse and addiction if they were not together. Malcolm believes that Marie is overreacting, claiming that, because she quit acting years ago, she is jealous of the actress who played Imani and that she is projecting her personal problems on him and his film. Marie affirms her position on his lack of acknowledgment and calls his talents ""mediocre"". While Marie is taking a bath, Malcolm describes to her the different women he had relationships with, who inspired the character of Imani, stating that only Imani\'s feelings of hopelessness were based on Marie.Later, Malcolm finds and reads the first critic review posted about his film. Despite the review being positive, he rants about the white female critic's political interpretation of his film as he did not intend it to be political. He laments that film critics are focusing too much on his black male identity and projecting politics into their interpretations, rather than judging him for his own merits. Marie playfully belittles his angry reaction to the positive review and his inability to take criticism, before the two appear to be bonding again following their arguments.Before the two can begin to have sex, Marie provokes him when she asks why he did not cast her as Imani, believing that she would have brought a vulnerability and authenticity to the character that could have made the film better. After they angrily accuse each other of being egotistical, Marie then brings out a knife and acts as if she is still a drug addict. She finally reveals she was acting out a scene as Imani to demonstrate authenticity, scaring but impressing Malcolm over how convincing she is. The two go to their bedroom and argue once more, until Marie lectures him about him taking her for granted and his lack of acknowledgment of how their genuine love for each other inspired the film.Their arguing finally stops as they go to bed without saying anything to each other, only thanking each other before they sleep. Malcolm wakes up alone in bed in the morning daylight. He finds Marie alone outside and joins her as they look across the distance, leaving the fate of their relationship unknown.",romance,"[[[235 229 229]

650,tt10101702,"After the time of the Mane 6, Sunny--a young Earth Pony--and her new Unicorn friend Izzy explore their world and strive to restore Harmony to Equestria. The unimaginable has happened: Equestria has lost its magic. Earth Ponies, Unicorns, and Pegasi are no longer friends and now live separated by species. But idealistic Earth Pony Sunny (Vanessa Hudgens) is determined to find a way to bring enchantment and unity back to their world. Teaming up with open-hearted Unicorn Izzy (Kimiko Glenn), the pair travel to faraway lands where they encounter the likes of charismatic and brave Pegasi Pipp (Sofia Carson) and Zipp (Liza Koshy) and the ever-responsible fellow Earth Pony Hitch (James Marsden). Their mission is full of misadventures, but these new best friends each possess their own unique and special gifts that may be just what this ponyverse needs to restore magic and prove that even little ponies can make a big difference.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Netflix', 'Many generations after the events of Princess Twilight Sparkle in the fourth generation (""Friendship Is Magic"" and ""My Little Pony: The Movie""), the land of Equestria is now entirely three-dimensional and all breeds of ponies - Earth ponies, Unicorn ponies and Pegasi ponies - all live separately apart. Twilight and the Mane 6 are now merely a legend, which barely anypony believes in. due to magic now being a myth, all ponies believe other ponies are evil. an orange Earth pony, Sunny Starscout, is told by her father that the legend is real. and, hoping to one day prove it to Equestria (especially Sunny's two friends, Sprout Cloverleaf and Hitch Trailblazer), make a homemade poster invitation to the Earth pony seaside town of Maritime Bay which they off in a red lantern.years pass after Sunny's father has died, Sunny and her friends are now grown up and Hitch works as Maritime Bay's Sheriff (Sprout assists Hitch as Deputy sheriff). things in Maritime Bay are only worse now that Sprout's mother, Phyllis Cloverleaf, has founded a security company called ""Canterlogic"" to attack non-Earth ponies. whilst Sunny still is determined to fix Equestria, she is failing and her friends still do not believe her. suddenly a curious unicorn named Isobella ""Izzy"" Moonbow appears at Maritime Bay, Sunny saves her from being arrested by Hitch and Sprout and escapes Maritime Bay with her. Hitch sets off to search for them, leaving a jealous Sprout in charge as substitute sheriff. as sheriff, Sprout turns the citisens of Maritime Bay into a hostile army and uses Phyllis' factory to construct a giant mechanical war machine called the ""Sproutous Maximus"", secretly planning to destroy all non-Earth ponies and rule Equestria. Sprout eventually becomes a dark evil dictator-like mayor obsessed with power and takes rule of Maritime Bay.after Sunny and Izzy escape Maritime Bay, Sunny asks Izzy if she has any magic. but Izzy tells Sunny that no unicorn has had any magic for generations. determined to discover deeper, Sunny and Izzy become friends and travel to the city of Zephyr Heights, the home of the pegasi. but once there they are captured and imprisoned by their ruler, Queen Haven. in the dungeon, Haven's younger daughter (who is also a pop icon and social media superstar), Princess Phillippa ""Pipp"" Petals, tells them that only the royal family can fly. but when they are left alone, her older sister (who is also a scientist, sports athlete and detective), Princess Zephyrina ""Zipp"" Storm, frees and befriends them and reveals to them that royal pegasi only fake flying via see-through wires and no pegasi can actually fly. Zipp shows the two friends her room in the palace, and they notice an image on the window of two magical crystals. they realise that the magic must have disappeared due to a crisis related to the crystals, and that one of the crystals is part of Queen Haven's crown. they plan to steal the crown in order to get the crystal.that night, the royals host a pop concert at the Zephyr Heights Palace with all the pegasi in the city. while Pipp performs her new single ""Glowin\' Up"", Sunny and Izzy sneak in with Zipp and replace Haven's crown with a fake while she is distracted by Pipp's singing. Hitch also disguises as a Pegasus and sneaks in. while they attempt to escape the palace, they accidentally enter the control room where the stallion controlling the lights and wire movements get horrified by the non-Pegasus ponies and accidentally freezes the wires and lights in the wrong place, causing Pipp to be revealed to not fly and Hitch losing his disguise in public. all 5 ponies escape Zephyr Heights and discuss the situation. after consideration, Hitch and Pipp agree to help the others find the other crystal and together they camp for the night. during the camp, Izzy reveals to Sunny that the poster invitation she made with her father was what made her want to go to Maritime Bay.Izzy leads the group to the Bridlewood Forest, the home of all unicorns. at her home, Izzy creates fake horns to disguise the group as unicorns in order to get the unicorn crystal. they find a crystal collector unicorn stallion who tells them that he found the crystal but lost it in a game to Alphabittle Blossomforth, a unicorn stallion who is the owner of a Bridlewood restaurant and a game champion who hosts competitions. Sunny challenges Alphabittle to a dancing contest to win the crystal, and wins. but shortly afterward loses her disguise and revealing herself to be an Earth pony. the five ponies try to escape the woods, but run into Queen Haven while being chased by Pegasus guards and causes and commotion between all the ponies. they decide to break up the commotion by putting the crystals together, hoping to activate the magic, but fail.they separate and Sunny returns home with Hitch to weep in her room, until she finds a clear crystal inside her bedroom lamp. she tells Hitch shortly before Sprout appears with the Sproutous Maximus and pursues them to find the other ponies. Sunny and Hitch warn the others, prompting them all to go to Sunny's lighthouse home to put the crystals together. Sprout finds them at Sunny\'s house and attempts to destroy the house in order to destroy Sunny and all her friends, but his plan is foiled by Hitch and Zipp who sabotage his machine, although accidentally destroying both Sprout's mech and Sunny's house in the process (although Sprout survives).

Thirteen-year-old Sam Cleary (Javon ""Wanna"" Walton) suspects that his mysterious and reclusive neighbor Mr. Smith (Sylvester Stallone) is actually a legend hiding in plain sight. Twenty Five years ago, Granite City's super-powered vigilante, Samaritan, was reported dead after a fiery warehouse battle with his rival, Nemesis. Most believe Samaritan perished in the fire, but some in the city, like Sam, have hope that he is still alive. With crime on the rise and the city on the brink of chaos, Sam makes it his mission to coax his neighbor out of hiding to save the city from ruin. 20 years after the epic battle in which the superhero Samaritan destroyed the supervillain and went missing. Two decades later, a kid from the outskirts meets an old man who lives in the house opposite. Soon the boy realizes that the elderly man is the missing superhero, and the reason for his disappearance is truly shocking. After surviving a life-altering tragedy, twin brothers became sworn enemies: Samaritan became the valiant protector of the innocent, and Nemesis evolved into a fierce antagonist with a mind aflame with revenge. Then, the benevolent defender vanished into thin air during the ultimate battle between good and evil, leaving the citizens of crime-ridden Granite City unprotected. But now, nearly three decades later, Samaritan's number one fan, Sam Cleary, is convinced he's found the missing superhero in the shape of Joe, a taciturn hermit and cryptic garbage collector. However, if Sam is right, the Samaritan's unforgiving arch-enemy just might be alive too. Superhumans Samaritan and Nemesis were antagonistic twin brothers who lived in Granite City. Evenly matched, the villainous Nemesis crafts a mystical sledgehammer that gave him an edge over the heroic Samaritan, and during a confrontation at the city's power plant, both were apparently killed as the plant exploded. Many people remain fans of Samaritan, and there are constant rumors that he is still alive.Twenty five years later, thirteen-year-old Sam Cleary tries his best to help his mother with their financial crisis, and, after being threatened with eviction, he accepts a job from a gang headed by Reza. The plan goes awry and Reza tries to blame Sam, but the real gang leader, Cyrus, is impressed and personally gives Sam $110.",action,"[[[38 44 58]

654,tt0805647,"A young boy and his grandmother have a run-in with a coven of witches and their leader.Reimagining Roald Dahl's beloved story for a modern audience, Robert Zemeckis's visually innovative film tells the darkly humorous and heartwarming tale of a young orphaned boy who, in late 1967, goes to live with his loving Grandma in the rural Alabama town of Demopolis. As the boy and his grandmother encounter some deceptively glamorous but thoroughly diabolical witches, she wisely whisks him away to a seaside resort. Regrettably, they arrive at precisely the same time that the world's Grand High Witch has gathered her fellow cronies from around the globe-undercover-to carry out her nefarious plans. Zemeckis is joined by a world-class team of filmmakers, including Alfonso CuarÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â³n, Guillermo del Toro and Kenya Barris. The cast includes powerhouse performances from Anne Hathaway, Octavia Spencer, Stanley Tucci, Kristin Chenoweth and Chris Rock, with newcomer Jahzir Kadeen Bruno as the brave young hero. It may come as a surprise; but, witches are real. They live among us, disguised as ordinary humans, and they feed off fear. Now, whether he likes it or not, an innocent orphaned boy is about to discover the shocking truth behind the demonic creatures, shortly after relocating to late 1960 Demopolis, Alabama, to live with his kind grandmother. And before long, a hair-raising encounter with the supernatural jolts grandma into action, forcing her to take her boy to a luxurious seaside hotel far away from home to protect him. Unfortunately, the otherwise impeccable resort is rife with danger, as a secret coven of fashionable witches is holding its annual conference in plain sight. It seems that their mighty leader, the scheming Grand High Witch of All the World, has hatched a plan, and no one is safe--especially children. Can they escape from their clutches? Will they give the evil witches a dose of their own medicine? In 1968 Alabama, a young boy goes to live with his grandmother following the death of his parents in Chicago. Slowly, the boy gets cheered up with his grandmother, buying him a pet mouse whom he names Daisy. One day, Charlie goes to buy a box of nails to train Daisy and to build a house for her as well. The boy is approached by a witch trying to lure him with a snake and a caramel, but the grandmother calls him and the witch disappears.After telling the grandmother about the encounter, the boy learns that the witches are in fact real. She says a witch cursed her best friend Alice into spending the rest of her life as a chicken. The grandmother says that witches never leave once they find a child. Frantically, they decide to stay in a nearby hotel where her cousin Eston is the executive chef. While there, grandmother tells, the boy how to tell a witch from an ordinary woman: real witches have claws instead of fingernails which they hide by wearing gloves, are bald which they hide by wearing wigs that give them rashes, have square feet with no toes which they hide by wearing sensible shoes, have a purple tinge in their pupils and have a powerful sense of smell which they use to sniff out children.The next day, the boy takes Daisy and a rope to go get some training done at a grand hall. As he walks there, he meets a gluttonous but friendly boy named Bruno, who gets pulled away by his mother. He then goes into the grand hall, thinking that he will be alone. As he's getting ready to train Daisy, a group of witches led by their all-powerful leader, the Grand High Witch, go into the grand hall; the boy hides under the stage and discovers that the Grand High Witch is planning to give the world's children a potion, which will be used in confectionery products that can transform the children into mice. The Grand High Witch waits for Bruno to arrive, for whom she gave a chocolate bar previously laced with the potion. After Bruno arrives, he turns into a mouse and enters the vent where the boy and Daisy are hiding. The Grand High Witch forcibly transforms the boy into a mice before they escape.Fleeing to the hotel room where the boy and his grandmother are staying, they tell the grandmother of the witches' plan and discover that the Grand High Witch is staying in the hotel room below them and that Daisy was once an orphaned young human girl named Mary turned into a mouse by a witch. He, Bruno, and Mary devise a plan to get a bottle of the potion so that the grandmother can devise a cure to turn them back into children. The plan is successful, but since, she is unable to create a cure, they instead decide to put the potion into a broth of pea soup which will be given to the witches during their dinner. All the witches except the Grand High Witch, who realizes that she had met the grandmother before as she was the witch that turned Alice into a chicken, drink the soup. While the mice steal the Grand High Witch's room key, the witches all begin turning into rats and chaos ensues.After she and the mice flee to the Grand High Witch's room, the grandmother starts to collect all the potions to destroy them. The Grand High Witch finds the grandmother, and prepares to kill her but the mice intervene and trick the Grand High Witch into swallowing her own potion, transforming her into a rat.

655,tt28568397,"When their mother takes off on a business trip, two bickering brothers unite to secretly attend the hottest party of the year before she returns. Friday morning  am.An academically focused and passionate football player, Siddharth Babil Khan always wanted every decision he made to be perfect. The stressful decision of applying to the right colleges got to him, and his brother's sudden interest in accompanying him to an early soccer match troubled him even more.Siddharth strongly believed that his brother would only make situations worse for him. After all, it was because of Adi Amrith Jayan that his classmates came up with an embarrassing nickname for him Shitty Siddy, since Sid takes too much time in the bathroom. Siddharth also knew that Adi had a hidden motive behind his sudden interest in watching his elder brother play. Siddharth had always watched the matches from the bench, and his brother coming to support him would be humiliating.nSiddharth tried to explain his situation to his mother, but it did not help his cause. Siddharth had his eyes on his mother's Juhi Chawla car, and now that he had a driving license, he wanted to take it out for a ride. Siddharth's mother categorically asked him not to touch the car while she was away on her business trip. They agreed to go on a weekend family trip together, during which Sid would finally get the chance to drive the car.Adi always wanted to become cool and popular in school, and he was desperately trying to find a way to get into the good books of the football players and the famous senior girls. While Sid did not approve of Adi's desperate behavior, he did take into consideration Adi's opinion about asking Natasha Sabharwal Medha Rana for prom. Sid had a major crush on Natasha for years, but he never dared to express his feelings. She was the popular girl in school, while he was the nerd.Sid was asked to wait on the bench before the match began. He was pretty much lost in his own romantic thoughts when Own Goal the nickname of the player injured his leg and was pulled out of the match. The coach asked Sid to join, and his only advice for Sid was to pass the ball to the star football player, Kabir Aditya Jain. After waiting on the bench for years, Sid finally got the chance to prove himself as a footballer. When the ball was passed to him, he could either attempt to score the goal or lose the opportunity while trying to pass it to Kabir. Sid took his chance and scored. Natasha and her sister Nitya were also at the game.nWhile the players and students celebrated the win, Sid left the field. But as soon as he left the restroom, he found 'fans' swarming all around him.nSid learns that Kabir is also looking to ask Natasha for the prom.Sid meets the school's counselor, who begs him to start his university application process, which he has been stalling for  months. Sid says that if he has to take a gap year, so be it, but he won't apply without doing proper research.To celebrate the grand win, the football team declared a Friday night party, popularly known as the FNP Friday Night Plan. Sid initially decided not to attend the party, but his decision changed when Natasha asked him to join. Natasha wanted to go on a latenight car ride, and Sid jumped at the opportunity, promising to bring his car to the party. Natasha says that the boys are meeting at JC's before the party and says that Kabir will text him the details.nAdi was over the moon once he realized that Sid would be attending the party. Sid could not leave Adi alone at home since their mother was away, so unwillingly, he had to take Adi along.Adi helped Sid prepare for the party by introducing him to all the party games and helping him dress right for the occasion. Sid felt extremely guilty driving his mother's car, but he had no other option. He had to prove to Natasha that he was worth going to prom with, and a latenight drive could be a way to her heart. Sid and Adi met with the rest of the football team at a shady eatery. The boys from the opposing school paid the owner of the eatery to turn on the sprinklers, leaving the ISM boys soaking wet.The prank was almost a ritual that both schools engaged in, and it was time for ISM to come up with an equally embarrassing prank idea. Adi stepped in and suggested they throw eggs at the opposing players. Sid was behind the wheel while the rest of the boys attacked the Global School boys with eggs. Unfortunately, instead of hitting a player, one of the eggs Adi threw landed on a police officer. As apologetic as Sid was about the incident, he could not afford to stay back and sort out the matter. The car belonged to his mother, and he could not land in trouble. But the police officer was not ready to let go of them. His ego was hurt, and he decided to teach the boys a lesson. He followed the car, and once Sid and Adi left it parked on the side of the road, he towed it after he found eggs inside the car. Sid and Adi ask Kabir to come pick them up for the party.After reaching the party, Sid decided to go back to the location where he left the car with Kabir's car and his driver. As soon as he reached it, he realized that the car had been towed. Sid called Adi for support, but as usual, his younger brother was not worried at all. Adi's logic was simple since they could not deal with the car issue, it was better to party. He advised Sid to inform their mother the next morning and leave it to her to deal with the police. Sid was guilttripping, and after disconnecting Adi's call, he dialed his mother's number. He had broken her trust, and he sought comfort in her voice. Meanwhile, Adi continued to portray his brother as an actionhero figure who not only scored a goal in the morning but was also a smooth driver who maneuvered through the Mumbai alleys and helped them complete the prank.Unable to make a decision, Sid arrived at the party. He confronted Adi and accused him of being a coward who always created trouble but did not have the guts to face any consequences. Adi tried to stay calm, but he was not ready to accept all the accusations. He retorted and accused Sid of being timid and always hiding behind his problems.nSid enjoyed dancing, but he never dared to shake a leg in public. Adi reminded Sid how he had failed to send a single college application simply because he lacked clarity. He was so hesitant about making the wrong decision that he chose not to even try.Adi believed that Sid changed after the death of their father. He wanted to become responsible and dependable, but in the process, he forgot to enjoy his life in the first place. Sid agreed that he could not bear the thought of disappointing their mother, and he challenged Adi to call their mother and confess the truth. Adi pretended to call her and convinced Sid that their mother was busy, and she said that she would take care of the mess after she returned home.nSid was relieved, and he finally decided to enjoy the night. Adi did what he thought was best for his brother. He knew that they would not be able to solve the problem that night, but Sid could have the most memorable night and enjoy his last few days in school.Everyone at the party welcomed Sid with open arms. He was having the time of his life, playing party games and dancing with his crush. Adi's best friend, Nitya Aadhya Anand, had overheard Sid and Adi's argument, and later, when Sid came up to her to talk, she explained how Adi had no illintentions for him. Sid realized he might have been too harsh on Adi, and they made up, singing and dancing to a song that they had composed. But Sid did not know then that Adi had called their mother in the meantime. Adi was feeling guilty after his confrontation with Sid. He wondered if he truly was a disappointment to their mother, and he called her for comfort. After receiving calls from both her sons, she figured out that something was going on. Her meeting had ended, and she decided to return home.Before Sid learned about the truth, he got a chance to spend some time alone with Natasha. He expressed how well he related to the poetry she had penned for English class, and Natasha explained that it was her sister, Nitya, who had composed it. Sid realized that he barely knew Natasha, and the bit he fell in love with was not really her. While Natasha showed interest in him, Sid made it clear that he did not wish to pursue a relationship that he did not see any potential in. After his honest conversation with Natasha, Sid apologized to Adi. As soon as the brothers united, Adi confessed that their mother was on her way back home.The plan was to somehow convince the police officer to allow them to take their car home. After reaching the police station, Sid begged the subinspector, Suhas Pingale Ninad Kamat, to forgive their childish mistake, and he was about to offer him money when Adi came to his rescue. Adi realized that the subinspector would be offended if he was offered money, and so he interrupted Sid and confessed that he was the one who flung an egg at him. After apologizing and appreciating the policeman for being an honest cop, Suhas Pingale allowed them to leave the station with their car.The brothers drove back home, and before their mother arrived, they managed to sort everything out on their own. As soon as their mother entered the house, she asked them to explain the phone calls, and the brothers decided to confess the truth. After overcoming what seemed impossibly stressful, they realized they could laugh about it with their mother.nThe two brothers became closer than ever before. Not only that, Sid realized that he barely knew the girl he had a crush on and could instead relate more to her sister, Nitya.nSid was the famous kid in school with a prom date and a newfound confidence to take the risk and apply to colleges.",comedy,"[[[255 255 255]

However, she soon may be the Madrigals' last hope when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is now in danger. Blessed to live in a secret, enchanted haven, the exceptional Madrigal family has found shelter in the bosom of a secured, mountainous realm in Colombia brimming with colour and kindness. However, as the mystical power of an inconspicuous artefact bestows its residents with supernatural gifts, introspective teen Mirabel has yet to receive her distinct talent. But when an unpredictable, terrible crisis puts the future of the tight-knit community in jeopardy, it is up to Mirabel to step up and try to save the day. Can the unlikely defender protect the family and find her true calling?ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Nick Riganas. It follows a multigenerational Colombian family, the Madrigals, led by a matriarch whose children and grandchildren - except for Mirabel Madrigal - receive magical gifts from a miracle that helps them serve the people in their rural community called the Encanto. When Mirabel learns that the family is losing their magic, she sets out to find out what is happening, and save her family and their magical house. While escaping her home from armed conflict, a young Alma Madrigal loses her husband Pedro but saves her triplet infant children Julieta, Pepa, and Bruno. The candle Alma carries with her becomes magical and creates a sentient house, the ""Casita"", for the Madrigals to live in. Years later a village grows, protected by the Casita, and members of the Madrigal family are gifted superhuman abilities they use to help the villagers (""The Family Madrigal""). However, Bruno's gift of precognition causes multiple conflicts that lead to the family vilifying him, while Mirabel, Julieta's youngest daughter, is treated differently for having no gift at all.During the evening of Pepa\'s youngest son Antonio being gifted with the ability to speak to animals, Mirabel suddenly sees the Casita cracking, but her warnings go unheeded when the Casita is found seemingly fine (""Waiting On A Miracle""). Mirabel, resolving to save the magic of the Casita, goes around to investigate and question her family members. Her older sister Luisa - who possesses superhuman strength - suggests that Bruno's room may hold some clues to the phenomenon (""Surface Pressure""). There, Mirabel sees a cave of sand and pieces of a slab of opaque jade glass, which - when repaired - constitute an image supposedly showing her causing the Casita to fall apart. After Mirabel leaves, she discovers that her family members' gifts are starting to weaken (""We Don't Talk About Bruno"").At a dinner where Mirabel's oldest sister Isabela -who can make flowers grow at will - is to become engaged to neighboring villager Mariano Guzman, Mirabel's oldest cousin Dolores - who possesses superhuman hearing - admits to overhearing Mirabel talking with her father about Bruno\'s vision. Mariano\'s proposal gets ruined when the Casita once again begins to crack, causing Pepa - whose emotions control the weather - to conjure up a thunderstorm much to everyone\'s shock. Isabela then blames Mirabel despite the latter denying her involvement in the cataclysm. Amidst the situation, Mirabel suddenly catches a glimpse of a man who she then chases through a hidden passage in the walls, discovering that he was none other than Bruno himself, who never really left their house because he still loves his family. Mirabel convinces him to make predictions again and gets Antonio's permission to use the latter's room. Bruno makes another vision, which shows the Casita collapsing and an image of Mirabel embracing Isabela.Mirabel goes to apologize but instead learns of Isabela\'s burden of being perfect and her desire not to marry Mariano. Having poured out her feelings, Isabela's powers start to develop and both sisters reconcile (""What Else Can I Do?""). However, Alma discovers Mirabel\'s actions and thoughtlessly blames her for the family\'s misfortunes. Mirabel then finally snaps at her, saying how everything was truly all her fault for making everyone do things her way. Their argument suddenly creates a gigantic fissure that destroys the Casita while Alma's magical candle extinguishes in Mirabel's hands in her futile effort to save it, effectively stripping the Madrigals of their powers. Alma later finds a tearful Mirabel at the river where Pedro died and finally admits her fault of pressuring the family, forgetting that the real gift given was not the powers but the family itself (""Dos Oruguitas""). Both reconcile and, with Bruno in tow, reunite the Madrigals to rebuild the Casita, assisted by the villagers. When Mirabel places the last doorknob, the Casita springs back to life and the magic returns (""All Of You""). The movie ends with the Madrigals taking their first family picture with Mirabel and Bruno now included in it.",comedy,"[[[ 64  90 167]

A young girl is kidnapped. Her mother, with no other option, teams up with the mysterious older woman next door to pursue the kidnapper a journey into the wilderness that will test their limits and expose dark and shocking secrets from their pasts. Thinking she'd put her dangerous past behind her, Lou (Allison Janney) finds her quiet life interrupted when a desperate mother (Jurnee Smollett) begs her to save her kidnapped daughter. As a massive storm rages, the two women risk their lives on a rescue mission that will test their limits and expose dark and shocking secrets from their pasts. Academy Award winner Allison Janney and Emmy Award nominee Jurnee Smollett star in Lou, alongside Logan Marshall-Green and Ridley Asha Bateman. The film is directed by Anna Foerster from a screenplay by Maggie Cohn and Jack Stanley, with Bad Robot's JJ Abrams, Hannah Minghella, and Jon Cohen producing. In 1986, on Orcas Island in Washington, Lou, a loner living with her dog Jax, goes to the village to buy some supplies. She talks to the sheriff about her arthritis and he tells her a copper bracelet could help her condition. A mother, Hannah, plays hide-and-seek with her young daughter, Vee, outside their home. Lou, her landlady, stops by on her way back home to say the rent is due the next day.Expecting a large storm, Chris, Hannah's male friend, offers to bring supplies. On his way home, he picks up a hitchhiker who kills him in his van. The hitchhiker cuts power to Hannah's home and while she is outside trying to restore power, he kidnaps Vee and flees with her on foot. Hannah runs to Lou's house, interrupting her suicide attempt, and tells her that Vee is missing. Before they are able to leave, Lou's truck blows up due to a bomb set by the hitchhiker. Eventually, Hannah and Lou set off tracking him and Vee into the night during the storm.Hannah informs Lou that the hitchhiker is Vee's father, Philip, a former Green Beret and war criminal she thought was dead. Lou finds and kills Philip's friends on the way, clearly showing she is more than she appears to be. She explains to Hannah she is an ex-CIA field agent of 26 years. Lou and Hannah track Philip and Vee to the beach at Eagle Bay. Lou sends Hannah to radio for help, while she goes to confront Philip and rescue Vee. After a standoff, it is revealed Philip is actually Lou's son, who tracked them down after she turned him in and hid them for protection. It is also revealed that Lou abandoned him as a child to avoid blowing her undercover mission in Iran. Philip injures Lou and leaves with Vee, intending to kill all of them together.Hannah contacts the sheriff, but a call from the United States Marshals Service forces him to stand down, as it is now a federal case. The sheriff goes to Eagle Bay nonetheless, where he finds Lou and gives her a copper bracelet. Meanwhile, Hannah arrives at the lighthouse and manages to get Vee away from Philip. After a scuffle, Hannah injures Philip and flees with Vee. Lou finds the lighthouse filled with explosives and sets them off from a distance, destroying it to signal an approaching CIA helicopter. Lou and Philip fight on the beach, until she gains the upper hand and hugs him. She apologizes as a CIA agent fires on them, and both Lou and Philip go under the water's surface.Later, Hannah and Vee are shown in Lou's house, packed up and ready to leave.

D'Artagnan, a young man from Gascony, is almost killed trying to stop a young woman from being kidnapped, by a mysterious older woman and her henchmen. He then travels to Paris to join the Musketeers of the Guard. D'Artagnan visits Capitaine de Trville, commander of the musketeers at its headquarters. Trville, who knew D'Artagnan's late father, says he will write him a letter of introduction. D'Artagnan sees one of the men who tried to kill him in the street below, and rushes out of the building to confront him, but, in so doing, unintentionally offends three musketeers, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, who each demand satisfaction; D'Artagnan decides to fight a duel with each of them that afternoon.",action,"[[[255 255 255]

Two children wake up in the middle of the night to find their father is missing, and all the windows and doors in their home have vanished. To cope with the strange situation, the two bring pillows and blankets to the living room and settle into a quiet slumber party. They play well worn videotapes of cartoons to fill the silence of the house and distract from the frightening and inexplicable situation.

687,tt10160976,"  France. A priest is murdered. An evil is spreading. The sequel to the worldwide smash hit follows Sister Irene as she once again comes facetoface with Valak, the demon nun. A followup to the enigmatic gothic horror about a strong evil that haunts and causes supernatural harm to everybody it comes into contact with. After the events of the first film, the said powerful evil now begins to spread in  throughout a town in France as word gets out that a priest has been violently murdered. A finished contemplative in her novitiate, Sister Irene, begins to investigate the murder, only to find a demon behind it the same evil that terrorized her in the original film as a nun Valak, whom she once again soon comes to encounter. In , Father Noiret and Jacques perform their daily chores at a church in Tarascon, France. While investigating a disturbance, Noiret is raised into the air, set on fire, and burned to death, all the while Jacques watches as he holds onto the priest's rosary.Following the events at Saint Cartha's monastery, Sister Irene now serves in a convent in Italy. Maurice works at a boarding school in France, where he has made friends with a young Irish girl named Sophie, as well as a teacher and her mother, Kate. Irene has a vision of Maurice asking her to save him, and the next day, she is asked by the Cardinal to investigate a series of deaths across Europe. While Irene travels to Tarascon, Sister Debra, a young novice, joins her without permission. During the train ride, Debra expresses her difficulty in accepting miracles, such as the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, while Irene explains to her the importance of faith.At Tarascon, Irene has a vision where she follows Jacques into an alley but ends up getting choked by Valak, the demon who takes the form of a nun. The next morning, Debra tells Irene that she had met with Jacques and he had given her Father Noiret's rosary. At the same time, in the boarding school, Sophie is bullied by her classmates and locked up in the abandoned chapel of the school where noone is allowed to enter. The bullies tell her to look at a window with a goat on the mosaic, and claim that if she looks away, the devil will appear to haunt her. The sun shines through the mosaic and makes the eye of the goat shine red.Irene and Debra travel to Palais des Papes and meet with a librarian who tells them that the demon they are investigating was an angel rejected by God and that the emblem on the rosary is the family crest of St. Lucy, who was martyred by a pagan. Though she was set on fire by the pagan, she miraculously did not die; St. Lucy's family rescued her eyes and dispersed throughout the world.",horror,"[[[0 0 0]

689,tt4479380,"A small army of well trained criminals led by Grace Lewis have hijacked a train deep beneath the English Channel. Special Forces operator Tom Buckingham is taking Dr. Sophie Hart from London to Paris to propose. When their train is deep inside the Channel Tunnel, Grace Lewis and her team of heavily-armed war criminals seize the train and hold hundreds of passengers hostage. Grace threatens to expose the British government's darkest secrets and blow up the Channel Tunnel if her ransom demands are not met. Unarmed and cut off from his counter-terror team, Tom is Sophie's and the other passengers' only hope to get out alive. Based on the best-selling novel by former SAS operator Andy McNab, SAS: RED NOTICE is a provocative and authentic portrayal of an emergency response operation and the singular mindset Tom needs to survive. Tom Buckingham, a suspended special forces operator, is taking Dr. Sophie Hart from London to Paris to propose. When their train is deep inside the Channel Tunnel, heavily armed mercenaries, led by Grace Lewis, seize control of it and hold everyone hostage. Grace threatens to blow up the Channel Tunnel and declare economic war on a government that has its fair share of secrets to keep. Unarmed and cut off from his counter terror team, Tom is the only hope that Sophie and the other passengers have to make it out alive. To save them he must embrace the unique psychology that makes Grace such a formidable adversary. Black Swans, a family-owned private military company led by American citizens William Lewis (Tom Wilkinson) and his adult children Grace (Ruby Rose) and Oliver (Owain Yeoman). Grace is the talented one and William's successor at the company. They were hired by SAS commander George Clements (Andy Serkis) to help a transnational gas pipeline clear through a remote village located at the fictional Gveli Pass in Georgia. Clements offers money to the villagers to vacate the village, but when they resist, a massacre ensues. Grace makes the decision to kill all the men and boys and leave the women to spread the fear. Grace sets the entire village ablaze. Their atrocities were secretly filmed by a little girl who led them to receive red notices and they were accused of crimes against humanity. The International Criminal Court demanded that the UK extradite the accused to the Hague to stand trial, because they live in North London. It turned out Prime Minister Atwood (Ray Panthaki) was behind Clements. Atwood knew that if William takes the stand he will mention Clements and then the road leads straight to Atwood. He secretly ordered Clements to kill William on the scene instead of arresting to cover up the link. William and Grace knew that SAS was going to move on them, but William refused to vacate the UK, his home.",action,"[[[146 146  56]

Poppy and Branch discover that they are but one of six different Troll tribes scattered over six different lands devoted to six different kinds of music: Funk, Country, Techno, Classical, Pop and Rock. Their world is about to get a lot bigger and a whole lot louder. A member of hard-rock royalty, Queen Barb, aided by her father King Thrash, wants to destroy all other kinds of music to let rock reign supreme. With the fate of the world at stake, Poppy and Branch, along with their friends, set out to visit all the other lands to unify the Trolls in harmony against Barb, who's looking to upstage them all. The film opens on a celebration of the Techno Trolls, which is crashed by the Hard Rock Trolls, led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her guitar's power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers Techno music.Poppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best. Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.Meanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the Techno string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power cord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with rock.Wanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.The balloon ends up in the land of Classical Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small flute named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the Country Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream. The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a Smooth Jazz Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.Inside the spaceship, the group meets the Funk Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both Pop and Funk, and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original Pop Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music. Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.After the Rock Trolls hi-jack the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both K-Pop and Reggaeton bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to so stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.Poppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a Yodel Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string.Biggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.Barb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending music, and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb's anguish.Cooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of sound making, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to sing together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of music are, and encouraged by her father, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship.Branch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.In a mid-credits scene, Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events of the film, and worried they have missed the party.",comedy,"[[[0 0 0]

When God orders Michael Hosea to marry her, he obeys him, but this command proves to be more of a challenge to him than he anticipated. Before being sold into prostitution, Sarah knows only rejection from men. As a child, she overhears her father, Alex Stanford, say that she should never have been born. Sarah learns that her father is married and her mother, Mae, is both his mistress and the victim of an abusive relationship. Sarah watches her mother grieve and eventually die, rejected by the man she loves. Now eighteen and going by the name Angel, she believes that she knows everything about men and how to give them what they want. One night, one of her customers is her father, and she knowingly has sex with him to punish him for how he treated her mother. He does not recognize her, but when he finds out the next morning, he commits suicide. When Michael enters her room and tells her he wants to marry her, she is thrown off guard, but remains aloof toward him. After she is nearly beaten to death, she agrees to marry Michael and leave with him as he nurses her back to health. Michael continues to surprise her as he claims to love her as his wife, and refuses to have sex with her. Michael is different from any man Angel has ever known, which leaves her confused and afraid to trust him. She runs away at her first opportunity, but Michael finds her and convinces her to come home. The next time Angel runs away, she gets a ride with Michael's brother-in-law, Paul, who hates her because of her past. When he demands payment for the ride, she pays by allowing Paul to have sex with her. Back in the city, Angel is forced back into prostitution, but finds it more difficult now to remain distant. When an angry Michael arrives at the brothel and takes her home again, the relief on her face when she sees him gives him hope and allows him to forgive her. For the first time, Angel is truly honest with Michael about her past, and their relationship begins to grow based on honesty and affection. Angel does not run away from Michael again for a long time. But when she is terrified to find herself falling in love with him, she remembers what love did to her mother, and forces herself to leave. This time, however, she stays away from her old life, and is able to make an honest living for the first time in her life. When Michael finds her yet again, she confesses that she ran away because she was scared to love him, and he assures her that she can trust him. She agrees to go home with him again. The final time Angel runs away, it is not because she does not love Michael, or because she is scared of her love, but out of a desire to sacrifice for him. She knows that what Michael wants most in the world is children and she is unable to bear children herself. She believes that by leaving, Michael will find someone else to marry and be happier without her. When she leaves this time, she intends to stay away forever, but Michael does not go after her, deciding that she needs to come back on her own. Angel is gone for three years, and has started a successful mission to help other young prostitutes, when Paul finally comes to find her. Paul realizes that he has been wrong all this time and tells Angel that Michael still loves her. Angel returns home to Michael, offering her love and her life. He is overjoyed when she gives him the only gift she has left to give, that being her real name, Sarah. God shows his faithfulness to Michael and Sarah throughout their lives, miraculously blessing them with children and success in all their endeavors, and they are happily married for the rest of their lives.",romance,"[[[111 122 154]

What at first appears to be a radical success soon reveals itself to be a remedy potentially worse than the disease. Suffering from a rare genetic blood disorder, Nobel Prizewinning scientist Dr Michael Morbius knows he is living on borrowed time. And after years of fruitless attempts to find a cure, Morbius is now running out of options. But this fatal condition has been plaguing him since childhood, and he can't afford to stop now.

However, what happens if the cure is worse than the disease? Throughout his childhood, Dr. Michael Morbius has struggled to live with a rare, but deadly blood illness. Therefore, he goes on a worldwide search for a cure that could hopefully help both him and other patients currently suffering from similar ailments. However, as he searches on and on, he comes across a solution in the form of vampire bat DNA. With the help of his assistant, Martine, Michael manages to introduce the DNA to his own bloodstream.

714,tt6673612,"A physician who can talk to animals embarks on an adventure to find a legendary island with a young apprentice and a crew of strange pets. After his wife's death, Dr. John Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.) decided to hide from the world with his beloved animals. But he has to take a journey to a mysterious island to find a healing tree, which is the only medicine that can help the dying Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) in Buckingham Palace. After his wife's death, the eccentric, famed doctor and veterinarian of Victorian England, John Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.) isolates himself away behind the high walls of Dolittle Manor with his animals for company. When Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) falls ill, a reluctant Dolittle is forced to go on an epic adventure to a mythical island in search of a cure, regaining his wit and courage as he crosses old adversaries and encounters wondrous creatures.ÃƒÂ‚Ã‚Â—Santhosh. The film starts with a storybook-like depiction of the life of 19th Century British veterinarian Dr. John Dolittle (Robert Downey, Jr.), as told by Poly the parrot (voice of Emma Thompson). He has the ability to communicate with animals, and he would travel the world with his beloved wife Lily (Kasia Smutniak), finding other scared or hurt animals and bringing them to their sanctuary. One day, Lily went sailing on a voyage with Poly, but she was caught in a terrible storm where she perished. Poly brought Dolittle her ring back, and he became so distraught that he closed up the sanctuary, shutting himself away from contact with other people.Years later, a boy named Tommy Stubbins (Harry Collett) is hunting with his uncle and cousin. He is too nervous to hit a bird, and he accidentally shoots a squirrel named Kevin (voice of Craig Robinson). Stubbins' uncle gives him a knife to put the squirrel out of his misery, but Stubbins instead takes it with him. Poly spots the boy and tells him to follow her, where she leads him to Dolittle's sanctuary. Stubbins is startled by Yoshi the polar bear (voice of John Cena), leading him to stumble into a trap. He is found by a girl called Lady Rose (Carmel Laniado), who was sent by Queen Victoria (Jessie Buckley) on an urgent matter.Inside the sanctuary, Dolittle is playing chess with several mice against Chee-Chee, (voice of Rami Malek) a cowardly gorilla, joined by Dab-Dab, (Octavia Spencer), a scatterbrained duck, and Jip, (voice of Tom Holland) a bespectacled dog. After learning that there are other humans outside, Dolittle sends Chee-Chee to answer the door. He and Stubbins freak each other out. Stubbins brings Kevin to Dolittle for help, while Lady Rose tells Dolittle that Queen Victoria has summoned him to Buckingham Palace. Dolittle helps Kevin recover but has no desire to leave his home. After much goading from Poly, Dolittle relents, tidies himself up, and heads out.Dolittle rides to Buckingham Palace using Plimpton (voice of Kumail Nanjiani), a neurotic ostrich, while Poly, Yoshi, Kevin, Jip, and Dab-Dab join. Upon arriving, he finds his former medical school rival, Dr. Blair Mudfly (Michael Sheen), there to check on the queen, brought up by Lord Badgley (Jim Broadbent). Dolittle and his animals enter the Queen's room, where he talks to her pet squid and learns that she was poisoned with deadly nightshade. The only cure is the Eden Fruit, which is on a far away island. Dolittle takes it upon himself to seek the tree out and bring back the fruit to save the Queen before an eclipse occurs, at which point she will perish. Although Stubbins wants to join Dolittle and be his apprentice after being amazed by the animals, Dolittle simply sends him back home.The next morning, Betsy the giraffe (voice of Selena Gomez) and Tutu the fox (voice of Marion Cotillard) join Poly in helping Stubbins escape his home and join Dolittle on his voyage. However, once they get to the docks, the ship has already departed. They spot a bridge, so Betsy rides with Stubbins until they manage to make it there and have him jump safely onto the ship.While on their journey, Stubbins takes time to learn the language of the other animals, which impresses Dolittle. Soon, Mudfly and his cronies sail nearby in their own ship and begin to catch up. Dolittle and Yoshi go underwater to get a whale to help pull them faster to the island. Dolittle's rope starts to break, so Stubbins tries to pull it back with Yoshi's help, but Chee-Chee freezes up when he has a chance to help pull. Dolittle does manage to get himself back onto the ship, but Chee-Chee is ashamed at himself for failing to help.Since their map doesn't have the exact location of the Eden Tree, the crew must stop at an island of bandits, run by King Rassouli (Antonio Banderas), who was also Lily's father. He is in possession of Lily's journal, which has the tree's location. Knowing that Rassouli would NOT be happy to see him, he and Stubbins attempt to disguise themselves. They are led by a dragonfly named James (voice of Jason Mantzoukas) to Rassouli's room where Stubbins tries to sneak in and find the journal while trying not to wake up Rassouli or his pet lionesses. The boy gets close, but Rassouli spots him and captures him, along with Dolittle.Rassouli throws Dolittle into a den where he must deal with a gold-fanged tiger named Barry (voice of Ralph Fiennes), who has serious mommy issues and has a bone to pick with Dolittle for not helping him get over this, while Stubbins is taken by the other bandits. Although Dolittle tries again, Barry is set on eating him. The other animals show up to help after Stubbins has James send them a message, with Yoshi blowing up the bandits' hideout, while Chee-Chee breaks into the cage and musters up the nerve to fight Barry. They help Dolittle get out as Stubbins has gotten the journal, but they are stopped by Mudfly and his soldiers, where the villain admits to having the Queen poisoned so that he can go find the cure and bask in all the rewards. They take the journal and destroy Dolittle's ship.As things are looking down, Yoshi and Plimpton bond over having negligent fathers. Dolittle expresses his disappointment in himself, which Rassouli overhears. Although he dislikes Dolittle for taking Lily away, he knows she would have wanted him to continue his quest. He gives him an old ship to allow him to return to the sea. Dolittle uses the help of whales to track down Mudfly's ship.The crew reaches the island but spot Mudfly's men already making their way inside. They climb up another way to get past the villains and eventually come across the tree and the fruit, but Mudfly and his men get there as well. Soon, they are confronted by a large dragon (Frances De La Tour), who begins to attack the soldiers. Dolittle saves Mudfly from getting killed, which leads to him having an epiphany about being a better person, only to push another soldier in the dragon's path before falling down a hole. After scaring away the other soldiers, the dragon sets her sights on Dolittle and his friends, but he then spots another dragon skeleton, which makes him realize she has lost her beloved, and so he sympathizes with her. He also notes that she is backed up internally, so he proceeds to give her an enema so that she may expel all the armor and weaponry that she has devoured over the years. She thanks Dolittle and allows him to take the fruit.With the Queen mere minutes from death, Dolittle and the animals manage to make it in time. However, Lord Badgley attempts to send the guards after them. The animals hold them off and get the fruit to Stubbins, who uses it to heal the Queen. Dolittle then learns from a stick bug that he left behind that Badgley is the mastermind behind the Queen's poisoning, as he has the vial of nightshade in his pocket. Badgley attempts to escape but is quickly subdued and imprisoned. The Queen thanks Dolittle and Stubbins for saving her.Dolittle returns to his sanctuary where he has officially taken Stubbins on as an apprentice, and he has decided to reopen the sanctuary to the public, as Lily would have wanted.During the closing credits, we see Mudfly still in the cave. He attempts to communicate with bats, only for them to swarm around him menacingly.",comedy,"[[[ 90 143 193]

715,tt6020800,"In the not too distant future, a drifter travelling through the desert discovers the largest gold nugget ever found. He must guard it from thieves amid harsh conditions and wild dogs while waiting for his partner to return. Set against the backdrop of a vast, unique and unforgiving landscape, Gold is a taut thriller about greed and the lengths people will go to secure themselves a fortune. When two drifters travelling through the desert stumble across the biggest gold nugget ever found, the dream of immense wealth and greed takes hold. They hatch a plan to protect and excavate their bounty with one man leaving to secure the necessary equipment. The other man remains and must endure the harsh desert climate, preying wolves and intruders, whilst battling the creeping doubt that he has been abandoned to his own fate. In the not too distant future, two drifters (Zac Efron, Anthony Hayes) traveling through the desert stumble across the biggest gold nugget ever found and the dream of immense wealth and greed takes hold. They hatch a plan to excavate their bounty with one man leaving to secure the necessary tools. The other man remains and must endure harsh desert elements, ravenous wild dogs, and mysterious intruders, while battling the sinking suspicion that he has been abandoned to his own fate. The film sets its place of unfolding at first, with grainy, dusty desert landscapes with barren trees, and a text on the screen calls it ""some time, someplace, not far from now."" An unnamed man, played by Zac Efron (and therefore will be referred to by the actor's name as the characters in the film remain unnamed), is seen traveling in a goods train compartment, eating away a piece of bread. At the other end of the compartment is a woman and her baby, both hungrily looking at the food. This seems to warm Efron's heart, and he offers the rest of the bread to her before getting down at his station. The place is a run-down outpost but seemingly serves as a connection point to an area called The Compound, where Efron's character plans to go. He asks around for a man who is supposed to drive him to the place, but the attendant at the outpost is as inhospitable as the barren desert all around. As he relieves himself in a dirty makeshift washroom, the second man, played by Anthony Hayes, arrives at the place. The two quickly set out on their journey towards The Compound, and the Hayes character seems to be opportunistic from the very beginning, as he charges extra money from the other man for gas and water.
